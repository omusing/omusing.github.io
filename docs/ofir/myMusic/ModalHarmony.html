<h3>Modal Harmony</h3>
</center>

In this course we study techniques for re-harmonization and modal harmony. While studing techniques for using modal chords and cadences, we're required to compose tunes using different modes (ie: scales other than Major and Minor scales)

<ul>
<li><a href="audio/modal-Ionian Theme.mp3">Ionian Theme</a> - Well then, a modal Ionian composition is not quite like a tune in 'Major Scale'.
<li><a href="audio/modal-Aeolian Theme.mp3">Aeolian Theme</a> - And Aeolian doesn't mean 'Minor Scale' either. This is my first recording of my piano (which is somewhat out of tune)
<li><a href="audio/modal-Phrygian Danza.mp3">Phrygian Theme</a> - The Phrygian mode is known for it's "sad" and dark qualities. I decided to make it happier by putting it into a 5/8 meter. And it's a Dance too, so let's see you dance in 5/8 (that should bring a laugh). I think it's my best composition so far, with regard to the recorder counterpoint and song structure.
<li><a href="audio/modal-Cross Modal Theme.mp3">Cross-Modal Theme</a> - This piece moves between different modes and utilizes various modal cadences. As a composition I find it rather incoherent and incomplete, and it is not one of my favorites.

</ul>
