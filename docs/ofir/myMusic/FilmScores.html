<li><a href="princess bride - sketch audio divx.avi">The Princess Bride</a> - This is a short musical score for the first two minutes of "The Princess Bride". <br>
The composition is based on Mixolydian mode, I arranged it for Flute, Oboe, a Strings Quartet and a Harp (the Oboe is played on an EWI, a woodwind synth, and the harp is played on a keyboard). <br>
The piece was recorded live, with me conducting "for picture". "Conducting for Picture" means that the movie is played back
and the conductor watches it while the performance takes place. As you will see, there are special marks ("Streamers and 
Punches") on the movie, which indicate musical cues and holds.
