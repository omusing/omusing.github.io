<h3>Introduction to Composition</h3>
</center>

The object of this course is to study the components of musical language (ie - pitch, length, dynamics and sonar shape/quality) and the part they take in musical composition. This is achieve via practical experience in composing music under certain limitations.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="audio/comp-ex1.mp3">Excercise 1</a> - A composition where only the length is arbitrary. The pitch, dynamics and sonar shape are of no importance.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex2.mp3">Excercise 2</a> - A composition using a constant rhythmic pattern, in this case a constant meter of 6+2+2+2/8<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex3.mp3">Excercise 3</a> - Changes and Negation in terms of sonar quality. The composition contains a motif that changes from a dark (minor) tonality to a light (major) one.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex4.mp3">Excercise 4</a> - Changes and Negation of lengths - effectively the composition presents seamless (?) switching between 3/4 and 5/4 meters. And some out-of-place Recorder improvisations.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex5.mp3">Excercise 5</a> - Composition without musical beats (no sense of rhythm). I wanted to achieve some sort of motive and development, despite the lack of rhythmic structure. The sheep and goat bleeting are introduced because like musical instruments, their voice has pitch, dynamics and shape, yet they do not bleet according to a defined rhythmic pattern.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex6.mp3">Excercise 6</a> - Changing between non-beat and beat in a composition. This is based on Excercise 5, I should have left the sheep bleets in it. The recorder playing in this piece allowed me to switch to a somewhat different style than my regular. The ending is a quote from Pink Floyd's Shine On You Crazy Diamond, or alternatively - from Ravel's Bolero. The solo over the chord sequence was entirely improvisational.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex7.mp3">Excercise 7</a> - The objection of this excercise is to combine on-beat (?) and off-beat musical ideas. I decided to write several short motives that are played off-beat and then re-played on-beat. There was also a general idea about making this a Hassidic dance, and the name of this piece is therefore Rothchild's Dance.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex8.mp3">Excercise 8</a> - "Subject and Background" - what is the subject, and what is the background? In this piece new subjects are introduced and then evolve into a background element (or vice versa). Most of this composition was actually written 15 years ago - I knew this classically-trained guitar player and I asked him to do the guitar 'solo'. It sounded awful; He said it wasn't properly written for guitar and he was obviously right. So I really wanted to see if I could pull it off as a 'larger than life' electric guitar solo. The larger than life solo is recorded from a smaller-than-average guitar amp with the overdrive set to 11.<br>

<li><a href="audio/comp-ex9.mp3">Excercise 9</a> - "Two-part composition in A-B-A format" - A tune based on two different parts (entitled A and B) where each has it's own different rhythm, rhythmic pattern, scale or mode.<br>
</ul>
