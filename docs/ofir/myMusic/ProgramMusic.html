<h3>Program Music</h3>
</center>

'Program Music' is an approach to music composition, in which the target music is 'programmed' to influence a certain feeling or concept. Examples of well known program music is Peter and the Wolf (where each animal is characterised by an instrument and a musical motif).<br>
In this course we learn how to compose a music to fit certain emotional situation, character or feeling.
<ul>
<li><a href="audio/ProgramMusic-RockyMountains.mp3">Rocky Mountains Blues</a> - Music to depict large open spaces. I guess Rocky Mountains is large enough. As for the blues - this is not a Blues composition, but rather a composition that bears a feeling of 'longing'. This is actually a re-work of a composition from an earlier course.
<li><a href="audio/ProgramMusic-Rimon Teachers.mp3">The Rimon Teachers</a> - This came as an excercise in writing a piece that grows faster by creating meter combinations, but without changing the tempo. The 'lyrics' are names of teachers in Rimon. Eli Benacot is the lecturer of the course. Oh... that's me singing all the parts and going out of tune and having troubles keeping time (thanks to the miracle of digital audio editing, this is listenable)
<li><a href="audio/ProgramMusic-Mock Turtle.mp3">The Mock Turtle</a> - Music that describes an animal: This piece attempts to depict a turtle trying to cross a highway at night.
<li><a href="audio/ProgramMusic-Woodpecker.mp3">The Woodpecker</a> - Music that describes an animal: This piece attempts to describe the insistent knocking created by a woodpecker, along with displaying its red and black colors and agility.
<li><a href="audio/ProgramMusic-Despair.mp3">Despair</a> - Music to depict deep regret and despair. Aparently, some "longing" and some "fear" crept in too. This is shamelessly influenced by Eleni Karaindrou's musical scores for the films of Theo Anglopoulus.
<li><a href="audio/ProgramMusic-Pans Theme.mp3">Pan's Theme</a> - I was requested to write a piece for a solo instrument, according to the following story: Pan (of the Greek Mythology) was in love with the nymph Syrinx. Zeus was attracted to Syrinx too, and asked her to spend a week in his bed. Syrinx refused and Zeus, outraged, turned her into marsh reeds. Upon discovering this, Pan cut the reeds and turned them into a flute. This is his song for Syrinx. <small>(ps: this tale is not quite the original tale, which you can read here: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Pan.html">Pan of the Greek Mythology</a>)</small>
