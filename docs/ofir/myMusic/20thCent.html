<h2>Ofir Zwebner's days at the Rimon School of Jazz</h2>
<h3>Composition in the styles of the 20th Century</h3>
</center>

The objective of this course is to study the different musical styles of the 20th century, and to attempt composing in the various styles presented.
<ul>
<li><a href="audio/20thCent-Nushi (Nina's Cat).mp3">Nushi (Nina's Cat)</a> - This follows Ravel suite for Violin and Cello, where both instrument exchange roles of lead and accompaniment. My duo is for an alto recorder and a clarinet. The piece is dominated by the sound of F#, which happens to be the tonal pitch of Nina (my piano teacher)'s cat.<br>
<li><a href="audio/20thCent-Blasphemous Faith.mp3">Blasphemous Faith</a> - My first attempt to write in an orchestral manner. The piece is based on a synthetic scale, taken from the notes that construct Bm and Fm chords.<br>
<li><a href="audio/20thCent-ForcedEntry.mp3">Forced Entry</a> - A Lousy composition. Nothing musical about it. The idea is to take two musical elements which consist on different meters, and to play them together and let them cycle through. Here is the 
<a href="audio/20thCent-ForcedEntry-1.mp3">first element</a> and here's the <a href="audio/20thCent-ForcedEntry-2.mp3">second element</a>.<br>
<li><a href="audio/20thCent-Nushi 3.mp3">Nushi (take 3)</a> - This is an extended version of the original "Nushi". It has been nominated for the 2005 Rimon Compositions Contest and it won 2nd place! :-) A live video recording is <a href="Nushi_Divx.avi">available here</a>, and you can also get <a href="audio/Nushi (Nina's Cat).pdf">partiture</a>.<br>
