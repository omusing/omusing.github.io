<a name="about"><h2>About This Site</h2></a>

<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>his site, although rarely updated, contains vast information about Camel, its music and the musicians who participated. You will also find lyrics, music notations, articles, interviews and even online tour memorabilia. Use the titles at the top of the screen to browse through the archive.
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he contents found here consists mainly on information that was contributed by many internet users. Please feel free to send in your opinions, requests, questions or new items. 
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>heck out the <a href="news/news-fr.htm" target="body"><b>What's New</b></a> sections to find out what's new and what's interesting!<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>his Site was originally spread through the internet via the rec.music.progressive newsgroup in the form of a single file
which grew into a 60K discography. Various older version of the discography (dating back in 1993!) have found their way around the web, yet <b>this</b> web site holds the most recent and updated information. 
In the beginning of 1996 a first HTML version of the entire text became available, and in October 1996 the single file was
converted to a REAL site. The site has been fully reconstructed in March 1997. It now contains about 180 HTML files, 170 graphic images, and covers 4.2 Megas<P>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he trivial notes and answers to questions are noted by 
<img src="images/trivia.gif" align=top alt="Trivia" width=30 height=18 border=0>.
Some trivia notes may be a bit farfetched, and may probably interest only
brain-damaged progressive fans... These are marked with 
<img src="images/triviap.gif" align=top alt="Trivia" width=30 height=18 border=0>.
Technical notes - Records, CDs and Cassette serial numbers, album lengths and
more are also available with their relevant icons. New stuff and updates are mostly marked with a <IMG SRC="images/new.gif" align=top ALT="New" width=40 height=18> symbol, but you should also check out the
<a href="news/news-fr.htm" target="body"><B>What's New</B></a> page.
Album names are written in Bold Italics, as in: <i><B>The Snow
Goose</i></b> <br>
Song Names are written in Italics, as in: <i>Ice</i><br>
Important names (such as bands, companies etc.) are written in Bold, such as
<B>Hatfield and the North</b>, or <B>CP</b> (being the
initials of <B>Camel Productions</b>.)<br>
Special references to songs appear with a relevant icon, such as Lyrics - <img src="images/lyrics.gif" width=20 height=16 align=absmiddle>, Guitar TAB files - <img src="images/tab.gif" width=20 height=16 align=absmiddle>,
Sound Samples - <img src="images/wav.gif" width=20 height=16 align=absmiddle>, and MIDI files - <img src="images/midi.gif" width=20 height=16 align=absmiddle>.

<p>
<font size=+2>B</font>rowse through this site using the navigation icons at the top. Every Icon leads to different sections of the site (ie The Discography, Links etc). You can also navigate using the simple text links at the bottom of each page. On each 

section 
there a list of sub-titles available on the dark left margin. At the bottom of the 
left margin you'll find a Camel image that leads to the top of the page, thus 
helping you reach the navigation buttons at the top. After most sub-titles you'll find a horizontal 'Camel' rule, which also leads to the top of the page.<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>his page is best viewed with Netscape 3.0, although it should be compatible
with previous versions as well. I've checked it on Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3.0
and it worked fine, apart for the color of the Links. I may be able to correct that
when I have time.<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>his site is intended to <B>Provide Information</B> for everyone. Therefore it includes LOTS of material, and I make all my resources available here. I restrict myself not to get carried away with graphics and effects so that users wi

th 640x480 screens and 'only' 256 colors can enjoy these pages just as anyone else. Some pages though, (such as the Songs Cross-Reference) may be a bit too difficult for older machines to handle.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he graphics on this site are all original (apart for obvious scans from albums

that animated GIF in your pages - I'd appreciate if you'd also link it to this page.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he material found in this archive may be "ancient" in Internet terms; The origins of some of the material escape my memory and records.

- my apologies in advance... Also, many thanks for those who have directed
questions and remarks to me - please never let go...<P>
