<h3>Freefall</h3>
<i>Bardens</i>
<p>
I'm in a freefall, like a snowflake falling,<br>
Down, down, down, down, down.<br>
I close my eyes inside my head I starfall<br>
Helpless to the ground.<br>
Down, down, down, down, down, oh yeah.<br>
<p>
Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire<br>
Flash by as I go.<br>
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher<br>
Than I'll ever know.<br>
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oooh.<br>
<p>
(repeat)<br>

<h3>Nimrodel<br>The Procession<br>The White Rider</h3>
<i>Latimer</i>
<p>
When he rides, my fears subside,<br>
For darkness turns once more to light.<br>
Through the skies, his white horse flies,<br>
To find a land beyond the night.<br>
<p>
Once he wore grey, he fell and slipped away<br>
From everybody's sight.<br>
The wizard of them all, came back from his fall<br>
This time wearing white.<br>
<p>
He has a certain air, as if he's never there,<br>
But somehow far away.<br>
And though he seems afar, like a distant star.<br>
His warm he can convey.<br>
<p>

<h3>Lady Fantasy<br><ul>Encounter
<br>Smiles for You <br>Lady Fantasy</ul></h3>
<i>Bardens, Ferguson, Latimer, Ward</i>
<p>
Listen very carefully, my words are about to unfold<br>
Concerning a lady I've seen but I never could hold<br>
I can see by your smile,<br>
Take a long while,<br>
The words that come through,<br>
I see that they're true,<br>
For she reminds me of you.<br>
<p>
Don't misunderstand me, it's not always easy to say<br>
The words in your head and your heart that you just can't explain<br>
I can see clearly,<br>
A face in the sky,<br>
Moon's in your eye,<br>
You're passing me by.<br>
Tell me the reason why.<br>
<p>
I can see clearly,<br>
A face in the sky,<br>
Moon's in your eye,<br>
You're passing me by.<br>
<p>
Saw you riding on a moon cloud,<br>
Saw you walking on a whirlpool,<br>
From the corner of my eye,<br>
I saw you.<br>
<p>
Saw you sitting on a sunbeam,<br>
In the middle of my daydream,<br>
Oh my Lady Fantasy,<br>
I love you.<br>
<p>
