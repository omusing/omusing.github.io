<h3>A Nod and a Wink</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover/LeBlanc</i><p>
<p>
Goodnight<br>
tired little eyes.<br>
Time to climb the wooden hill.<br>
<br>
Sleep tight<br>
safe in the night.<br>
Wander through your dreams at will.<br>
<br>
The stars are awake<br>
and blinking their silvery tears on the moon.<br>
Don't be afraid,<br>
for carpets of magic can fly through the sky.<br>
It will take you wherever you wish,<br>
but come back to me<br>
the same way that you leave.<br>
In day or night, in dark or light,<br>
just come back to me<br>
the same way that you leave.<br>
Then you can always find me in your dreams.<br>

<h3>Simple Pleasures</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>
<P>
When she left the room<br>
her perfume filled the air.<br>
Thirty years gone<br>
it's still there.<br>
<br>
How I love to breathe<br>
the air she left behind.<br>
This trick of fortune<br>
fills my mind.<br>
<br>
Simple pleasures,<br>
silver treasures.<br>
Take me far, far away...<br>
<br>
Faded roses on<br>
a table set for two.<br>
An open window<br>
shares my view.<br>
<br>
Out among the fields,<br>
breezes dance and play.<br>
Tender mercies<br>
soothe my day.<br>
<br>
Simple pleasures,<br>
silver treasures,<br>
Take me far, far away...<br>

<h3>A Boy's Life</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>
<P>
I try to see through your eyes<br>
but life keeps changing the view<br>
Are we so unalike?<br>
It's a boy's life after all..<br>
It's a boy's life<br>
afterall.<br>
<br>
Have I really forgotten<br>
the way I felt at fifteen?<br>
When things were taken for granted,<br>
It's a boy's life after all...<br>
It's a boy's life<br>
afterall.<br>

<h3>Fox Hill</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>
<P>
There's a fox on the hill<br>
and he's standing still,<br>
as if he's trying to hide.<br>
<br>
My horse is going after him,<br>
he thinks he'll easily catch him<br>
but the Tod is sly.<br>
<br>
Lazy days and crazy ways,<br>
the sun is high and I'm feelin' fine.<br>
(and so is ol' Dart)<br>
<br>
My horse is unconcerned<br>
as he takes a tricky turn<br>
on the heels of the fox.<br>
<br>
But as we come around,<br>
Mr. Tod is off the ground<br>
smiling down from the rocks.<br>
<br>
Crazy days and lazy ways,<br>
the sun is nigh and I'm feelin' high.<br>
(it's only rock and roll)<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm an artful dodger"<br>
said the fox,<br>
"they never catch me, no!<br>
I lead them all a merry dance".<br>
<br>
"I see you're on a pleasure run,<br>
out to have a bit of fun...<br>
perhaps you'd like a game of chance?"<br>
<br>
"So may I propose a little game<br>
...if you'll agree.<br>
I wager you'll never catch me!"<br>
And in a flash,<br>
the fox flipped his tail,<br>
my horse took the bit,<br>
and the chase was on...<br>
<br>
Now we're back on the hill<br>
we're going faster still.<br>
and we're nose to nose.<br>
<br>
Well my horse is going faster<br>
but the fox is going past us,<br>
laughing as he goes!<br>
<br>
Crazy daisy, lazy crasy,<br>
Matching Mole; a toad in the hole;<br>
(it's only fox and foal).<br>
<br>
I'm just a happy fox and clearly,<br>
you're just foal at heart.<br>
I hope we meet again.<br>
You've made me<br>
oh, such a happy fox.<br>
Cheerio!<br>

<h3>The Miller's Tale</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>

<P>
And the two friends went home.<br>
No need for words, they are as one.<br>
And now summer's over,<br>
the light on the fields grows older.<br>

<h3>For Today</h3>
<small><i>(for the courageous spirit of the High Diver on 11st September)</i></small><br>
<I>Latimer/Hoover/LeBlanc</I>
<p>
I saw a pearl of wisdom<br>
in the spirit of a man<br>
as he saved<br>
the day he lost.<br>
<br>
Time will say I told you so<br>
if we look back in regret.<br>
Never give a day away.<br>
It won't return the same again.<br>
<br>
Nothing can last<br>
there are no second chances.<br>
Never give a day away.<br>
Always live for today.<br>
<br>

<br>
<P>
