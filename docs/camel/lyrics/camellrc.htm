<h3>Slow Yourself Down</h3>
<i>Ward/Latimer</i>
<p>
They tell me you're searching for a new place,<br>
They tell me tomorrow will have a true face.<br>
They say that I don't understand,<br>
When you speak of your summertime land -<br>
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along.<br>
<p>
They tell me your past often hurt you,<br>
And even your friends, they would desert you.<br>
But now you are beginning to see,<br>
The same things have happened to me -<br>
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along.<br>
<p>
You tell me your dreams have been broken,<br>
And not enough words have been spoken.<br>
The time has come to see it through.<br>
Slow down 'coz I'm coming with you -<br>
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along.<br>
<p>

<h3>Mystic Queen</h3>
<i>Bardens</i>
<p>
Have you seen the Mystic Queen<br>
Riding in her limousine<br>
Over hills and dales 'til morning...<br>
<p>
If you like I'll take you there<br>
Find some colours you can wear<br>
Colour that you've only seen while sleeping.<br>
<p>

<h3>Separation</h3>
<i>Latimer</i>
<p>
You know we're fighting every day,<br>
It's as if somehow we've lost our way.<br>
When we'd first begun, yeah, we lived as one,<br>
Now as time goes on, we move our own way.<br>
<p>
It's just no use in going on<br>
When all the feeling now has gone.<br>
You know we both have tried,<br>
Yeah, we both have lied,<br>
Now as tears subside, we move our own way.<br>
<p>
Separation's the only way...<br>
Separation starts today...<br>
<p>
(repeat verse)<br>

<a name="never let go"></a>
<h3>Never Let Go</h3>
<i>Latimer</i>
<p>
Crazy preachers of our doom<br>
Telling us there is no room.<br>
Not enough for all mankind<br>
And the seas of time are running dry.<br>
Don't they know it's a lie...<br>
<p>
Man is born with the will to survive,<br>
He'll not take no for an answer.<br>
He will get by, somehow he'll try,<br>
He won't take no, never let go, no...<br>
<p>
I hear them talk about Kingdom Come,<br>
I hear them discuss Armageddon...<br>
They say the hour is getting late,<br>
But I can still hear someone say,<br>
This is not the way...<br>
<p>
(repeat)<br>
<p>

<h3>Curiosity</h3>
<i>Bardens</i>
<p>
Sail, sail away,<br>
There you go,<br>
To a place you know.<BR>
Why not let me come along,<br>
I won't tell no one.<br>
<p>
Now our bodies have entwined,<br>
Touch me with your mind.<br>
Your dreams are a mystery,<br>
Please share them with me.<br>
<p>
Curiosity is killing me,<br>
I just got to know.<br>
Curiosity is killing me,<br>
I just got to know -<br>
Where, tell me where,<br>
Where are you sailing...<br>
<p>
(repeat)<br>
