<h3>Lost and Found</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i><p>
Where have you come from,<br>
where have you been?<br>
How can you know<br>
unless you begin?<br>
Turn around,<br>
giving more than you take.<br>
Lost and found<br>
in the past.
<p>
The chance of a lifetime<br>
is passing you by.<br>
Use it or lose it<br>
in the wink of an eye.<br>
Turn around,<br>
giving more than you take.<br>
Lost and found<br>
in the past.

<h3>The Final Encore</h3>
<i>Latimer</i><p>
After words<br>
and long goodbyes...<br>
Tears and lies<br>
at the end of the day.
<p>
An early night<br>
and madness rains...<br>
The moon pulls your dreams<br>
and the pressure fades.
<p>
And now,<br>
the final encore,<br>
a last farewall.<br>
The fantazy is over,<br>
the spirit flies away...

<h3>Rajaz</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i><p>
When the desert sun has passed horizon's final light<br>
and darkness takes it's place...<br>
We will pause to take our rest.<br>
Sharing song of love,<br>
tales of tragedy.
<p>
<ul>
The souls of heaven<br>
are stars at night.<br>
They will guide us on our way,<br>
until we meet again<br>
another day.
</ul>
<p>
When a poet sings the song and all are hypnotised,<br>
enchanted by the sound...<br>
We will mark the time as one,<br>
tandem in the sun.<br>
The rhythm of a hymn.
<p>
<ul>
The souls of heaven<br>
are stars at night.<br>
They will guide us on our way,<br>
until we meet again<br>
another day.
</ul>
<p>
When the dawn has come<br>
sing the song,<br>
all day long.
<p>
We will move as one,<br>
bear the load<br>
on the road.
<p>
<ul>
The souls of heaven<br>
turn to stars<br>
every single night<br>
all across the sky...<br>
they shine.
</ul>

<h3>Shout</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i><p>
Another day...<br>
I might have found the words to say<br>
all the things i meant to say.<br>
All the years that passed between<br>
you never understood the meaning of my way.<br>
Another day there might have been<br>
some other way to make<br>
the sacrifice.
<p>
Another day...<br>
I would try to be a friend,<br>
you would never let me in.<br>
If I could have it otherwise,<br>
I'd chase the demons from your eyes to ease your soul.<br>
But now you've reached this other side<br>
where hopes and broken dreams can't turn the tide.
<p>
<ul>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
to the top.<br>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
through your defenses...<br>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
to the top.<br>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
</ul>
<p>
Another day...<br>
you might have found your destiny,<br>
knowing that it's meant to be.<br>
A self-effacing prodigy,<br>
you gave it up for infamy<br>
and fell from grace.
<p>
<ul>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
to the top.<br>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
through your pretenses...<br>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
to the top.<br>
Lay down your defenses,<br>
<b>SHOUT!</b><br>
to the top.
</ul>

<h3>Straight to My Heart</h3>
<i>Latimer</i><p>
<p>
I was born in '49,<br>
in a family of four.<br>
Father had his own band<br>
just after the war.
<p>
My brother and I had a radio<br>
and every night we'd share,<br>
waves from Luxembourg<br>
that came though the air.
<p>
Days were full of music<br>
and nights were the same.<br>
And though the songs are different now<br>
some things never change...
<p>
I can't explain the way I feel.<br>
Why, event to this day,<br>
I steel love the sound of that red guitar.<br>
It takes my breath away<br>
and goes straight...<br>
to my heart.<br>
Straight to my heart.<br>
Straight to my heart.

<h3>Lawrence</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i><p>
All across this barren land,<br>
elder voices tell<br>
stories of a desert ghost.<br>
The legend of a man<br>
swallowed by the sand.
<p>
High upon the red dunes,<br>
a prophet in the wind...<br>
a vision like a mirage,<br>
rises from a man<br>
swallowed by the sand.
<p>
Fading...<br>
into the shadows<br>
of the legend<br>
you became.
<p>
Fading...<br>
into the mystery<br>
and the romance<br>
of your fame.
