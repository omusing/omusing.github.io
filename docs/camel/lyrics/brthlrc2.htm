Breathless (Latimer/Bardens/Ward) 

She is my first love
Graceful in all her ways
Holding the insight
Turning the sky from night into day
She won't fail to take my breath away

So soft the silence
She brings before the dawn
A time of twilight
When all the world waits, to be reborn

Nobody knows her name
No one, knows how she came to be here at all
Giving her loving, hoping, to everyone
Giving her hoping, to everyone (x6)

Old as the hills
Young just like the rising sun
Over fields, that lie
Away beneath her feet
Every time we meet
She takes my breath away

Echoes (Latimer/Bardens/Ward) 

Out of the mist, rising
Ten thousand Navajo braves
Shining, like golden eagles in flight
Climbing, higher on the plain

Born of the earth, set free 
To run away with the sun
So free, to sing in tune with the world
Gladly, dance for the rain


So many moons have flown
Now all your ghosts dance the long shadow
War cries that died on your lips
Echo above the plain

Wing and a Prayer (Latimer, Bardens)

High rise blocks out the blue
The pavement sticks like glue
You're getting nowhere
Hitch a ride on a wing and a prayer

You're crying out loud
A face lost in the crowd
A voice no-one can hear
You'll get by on a wing and a prayer

So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go


You better believe it, Rhyme,
         under no doubt
(Love is everywhere)

(And then you can feel it, you're halfway 
there)
Feels like you're gonna drown

(It's just another lovesong, ain't
no big thing)
Reach out, no one's there

(Once you get the feelin', makes you want to sing)

Just hold on to a wing and a prayer


(It's just a little homegrown,
 then  lots of  me)
[Then  light    me]
                Smoke in the air

(Then take it or leave it, it come
for free)
You'll slowly slip away

(It's just another love song, ain't
no big thing)
All senses prevail

(Once you got the feelin', makes you wanna sing)

You'll fly home on a wing and a prayer


So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go

-----

(Now) You better believe it,
love is everywhere
(you walk that high wire)

And then if you feel it, you're halfway
there
(In truth you'll wanta fly)

It's just another love song, ain't
no big thing
(You'll, fly everywhere)

Once you got the feelin', makes you want to sing

(If you trust to a wing and a prayer)


(So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go)

It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feelin', makes you want to sing
It's just a little homegrown, then lots of me
Take it or leave it, it come for free
(If you trust to a wing and a prayer)

You better believe it, love is everywhere
And if you can feel it, you're halfway there
It's jus' a little love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feelin', make you wanta sing
(If you trust to a wing and a prayer)

Just a little homegrown, then lots of me
Take it or leave it, it come for free
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
And once you got the feelin', make you wanta sing

Down on the Farm (Sinclair)

Every Sunday morning, before daybreak
Down upon the farm, on the fishpond
All the little ducks, they go paddling
Look out goldfish you're for breakfast

Sunday morning hear the churchbells ringing
High up in the trees the birds were singing
In the dewey grass, spiders spinning
Rooster calls and cocks his doodle

All around the farm, animals stirring
Through the morning mist the bulls are beefing
And across the meadows cows are munching
Crazy but it's time for milking

There's such, a lot to be done on the farm
In the sunshine and when, it's lunchtime
It's hop down the pub for a pint
Back on the tractor to finish the plowing

Standing all alone, Fred the scarecrow
Hasn't got a clue, how the wheat grows
Doesn't mind the rain, hates the cold though
Specially when those icewinds blow snow

All along the lane, bees are buzzing
Furry things in hedgerows stirring
In amongst the corn the bunnies are bouncing
Must have springs upon their feet

Be-hind the cowshed
The plowman is taking a peek
At the, farmer's daughter who's hanging her undies
In the sun, better get on your boots and join us

Down on the farm, better get on your boots and join us (x5)
Down here on the farm

It's a lovely day for country walking
Vic is on his bike, Vinny's skateboarding
Farmer and his dog, out back shooting
Gun goes off and birds stop tweeting

Lot's of smelly, stinks around the farmyard
Great big pile of sh(it)! behind the rhubarb
Sitting in his pram, baby bunting
Dogs are up and starts his grunting

Give him a drink, he's gone pink
Wants his mummy needs changing I think
Such a lot can be done on the farm
In the sunshine and when it's lunchtime
It's hop down the pub for a pint
Sneak out the backway with Nelly the barmaid
To the woods, better get on your boots and join us

Down on the farm, better get on your boots and join us ...

Starlight Ride (Latimer, Bardens)

There's a road that I must go
There are short cuts that I know
But I know that we'll make it eventually
On this starlight, ride

There's a fire down below (that remain in me)
When the chilly winds will blow (will you comfort me)
But as long as we let all our feelings show
It will never, die

Feel the magic in the air (in the summer night)
See the road ahead is clear (doin' 4 and 5)
Let's take every moment and drink it down
Like a mellow, wine

In the slipstream of the night (hear the music play)
Though which road is crystal bright (feel from far away)
And it leads us from here to forevermore
On this starlight, ride
=====
Summer Lightning (Latimer/Sinclair) 

Here's that feeling once again
'cross the room you turn and then
Smile, I've known that smile before
Yes we've been friends for sure

Dreams and memories so clear
Share the love that we once had
Let the music carry on
Keep on dancing


(Summer night) Here on that shoreline
(Meet again) And drink that wine
(Gaze your glance) Still thinking of you
(Missing all) The things you do

Here in the falling rain
Once again we play love's game
(Keep on dancing)

You cast that magic
(Déjà-vu) It's in your stars
(They reveal) You know the answer
(They are true) So for a while

Let's renew all those lover's ties
Summer lightning in your eye
It keeps on dancing


I've always known love
Would return to life in the darkest day
We will meet again
Better on an later lifetime
'cross the skyline, I'll always be your friend
Send my love to you
There'll be no sad goodbyes
=====
You Make Me Smile (Latimer, Bardens)

I was lookin' for an easy ride
Never wantin' to get inside
Now I know I'm letting go of
My defenses and cold hard lines
Because you've shown me there's better times
Changing my life so many ways (and) I love you

Chorus - Because you make me smile
Just like the morning sun, hahh
You make me smile

You know you make me smile
So many ways at once
Oh, you make me smile


Why this feelin' that came before
The answer to that I'm not quite sure
Maybe time will help this rhyme (and)
All I know is I'm different now
You make me happy and you're somehow always there
You understand I'm just a man and I love you

Chorus (x2)

You make me smile (x3)
Ah you make me smile (x2)

Rainbow's End (Latimer, Bardens)

We began by sharing more together
Black against white, made it alright
Things are different now, we've grown apart
So it's ok, call it a day
What can I say
Let's just remember what we had

Keep on looking for that rainbow, rainbow
Rainbow's end
And when you find the rainbow, rainbow
Start out again

I know now that it all seems wrong
But you had no choice
Change is a thing we can't avoid
And even though we're singing different song(s)
Love still lasts, time will pass
You and I will always get by, so

Keep on looking for that rainbow, rainbow
Rainbow's end
And when you find the rainbow, rainbow
Start out again

Keep on looking for that rainbow, rainbow
Start again
I hope you find your rainbow, rainbow
Rainbow's end
