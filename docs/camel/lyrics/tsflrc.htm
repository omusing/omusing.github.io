<h3>No Easy Answer</h3>
<i>Latimer</i>
<p>
No easy answers<br>
come to me<br>
that i can see<br>
<p>
No easy answers<br>
were close at hand<br>
when i began<br>
to ask the questions one by one<br>
so all the loose ends stay undone<br>
<p>
An easy answer<br>
could help me out<br>
relieve my doubt<br>
<p>
Is there an answer<br>
or will i be<br>
never to see<br>
the light that shines at jorney's end<br>
or will i just go around again<br>
<p>
You know it's always easy to say<br>
you've gotta take it day by day<br>
but sometimes it can be hard...<br>
<p>
You know the answer's undefined<br>
It's only ever in your mind.<br>
<p>

<h3>You Are The One</h3>
<i>Latimer</i>
<p>
When i'm on my own<br>
and out of my mind<br>
I realise how i've grown,<br>
and changed my old line<br>
<p>
Learning how to give<br>
and not be afraid,<br>
of the place where i live<br>
and mistakes i have made<br>
<p>
You are the one<br>
changing my life.<br>
You are the one<br>
making it right.<br>
You are the one<br>
warming my nights -<br>
You are the one.<br>
<p>
You are the one<br>
giving me all.<br>
You are the one<br>
opening doors.<br>
You are the one<br>
hearing my call -<br>
You are the one.<br>
<p>
looking 'round I can see<br>
you are still here<br>
Not in sight but in me<br>
your being appears.<br>
<p>

<h3>Heroes</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i>
<p>
Image of mine are you just a myth?<br>
Aiming for the stars and a need to exist<br>
Singing your life to its final bar,<br>
Staging all the scenes to avoid who you are.<br>
<p>
Idol of mine will you lead me on?<br>
Build for me the dreams that i'm longing to own.<br>
make me secure - be my fallacy.<br>
You are all my world if for only today.<br>
<p>
And live for evermore...<br>
<p>
Heroes i call for you!<br>
Legend to feed my heart and soul.<br>
Heroes i cry for you!<br>
Legend will blees your heart of soul.<br>
<p>

<h3>Lullabye</h3>
<i>Latimer</i>
<p>
This is just a song<br>
to help you through the night<br>
just like a lullabye.<br>
And if you're not strong<br>
and everything ain't right,<br>
this is my lullabye.<br>
<p>

<h3>Manic</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i>
<p>
One day I'm up next day i'm down,<br>
I run from duck to dawn.<br>
The paranoia seizes me<br>
the nightmares carry on.<br>
<p>
I'm looking on the bright side<br>
You're looking on the wrong side<br>
You really don't know which side<br>
A devious dream in my mind.<br>
<p>
But there is no way out and yesss<br>
the dye is casting thin<br>
Between the line and razor edge<br>
They crystalise the end.<br>
<p>
I'm looking on the dark side<br>
You're looking on the outside<br>
You'll never know what's inside<br>
A face to erase what you find<br>
<p>
I know what I'm doing<br>
I'm feeling so fine now<br>
Sorry I worried you.<br>
Thumbs up truly,<br>
I'm okay I though today<br>
I haven't had a drink for, say,<br>
an age, and yes I'm feeling fit<br>
a day in which I'm never sick<br>
with both ends on the candle lit.<br>
<p>
There is no way out and<br>
I can never be my friend.<br>
The enemy i fear is me,<br>
so where does it all end...<br>
<p>

<h3>Camelogue</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i>
<p>
Standing on the crosswalk -<br>
wonder which direction to go.<br>
Listen to the smalltalk -<br>
claiming how they told me so.<br>
<p>
I improvise,<br>
have to keep going for the song and the road.<br>
A lonely rise,<br>
now i'm relying on a song of my own.<br>
<p>
Early on detected -<br>
Trouble had divided in two.<br>
Acting unaffected -<br>
reflecting on the things i do.<br>
<p>
A solo rise,<br>
have to keep going for the song and the road.<br>
Temptation sighs,<br>
leave us a memory we've loved and known.<br>
<p>
Fighting the lead -<br>
I was so confused<br>
feeling so accused.<br>
<p>
A solo rise -<br>
have to keep going for the song and the road.<br>
Temptation sighs,<br>
leave us a memory we've loved and known.<br>
What can i do?<br>
<p>

<h3>Today's Goodbye</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i>
<p>
Closing my eyes reliving a time when love was strong -<br>
Feelin' your change of heart a sign when love went wrong -<br>
I'm tired of analysing everything you say,<br>
Trying to hold on to what went before the day,<br>
we threw it away.<br>
<p>
It seems now there isn't any need to keep hangin' on -<br>
The mood in the night of a lonely room has gone on too long -<br>
I've looked from every angle I have found and yet,<br>
Trying to hold on and pick up the pieces we've left<br>
or try to forget.<br>
<p>
Today's<br>
(A last chance to decide)<br>
Goodbye<br>
(Unless you change your mind)<br>
And I won't ask again<br>
I never could pretend.<br>
<p>
Today's<br>
(A last chance to decide)<br>
Goodbye<br>
(Unless you change your mind)<br>
But I won't ask again,<br>
Oh no,<br>
No I won't ask again.<br>
<p>
I've looked from every angle I have found and yet,<br>
Trying to hold on and pick up the pieces we've left<br>
or try to forget.<br>
<p>

<h3>A Heart's Desire</h3>
<i>Latimer/Hoover</i>
<p>
The light is fading<br>
The cause invading<br>
all the hopes that you were building<br>
on tomorrow<br>
Now you must go.<br>
<p>
So stretch your wings,<br>
as nature sings<br>
her farewell lullabye to soothe you<br>
through the changes<br>
When you must go.<br>
<p>
The gift is knowing<br>
your strength in going<br>
when the time has gone beyond<br>
your heart's desire,<br>
and you must go.<br>
<p>
