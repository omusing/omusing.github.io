<h3>Irish Air</h3>
<i>Traditional Gaelic/John Morris</i><p>
In this quiet place I stand alone, <br>
from my homeland far away. <br>
And my empty heart cannot recall, <br>
the forgotten dreams that brought me joy
<P>
Had I ways to shed the wasted years, <br>
I would travel to my kin.<br>
and with strength and faith in God above, <br>
there in Ireland I would gladly die.

<h3>Harbour of Tears</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>
<P>
I am one of seven brothers.<br>
Five of us must leave and start again.<br>
In this land of Saints and Martyrs,<br>
Tears of sadness hide within the rain.<br>
<P>
So fare thee well, Remember me... <br>
Sail from the Harbour of Tearss

I can hear my father calling <br>
'Godspeed, my son, <br>
wherever you may go' <br>
He looked so small <br>
down on the quayside. <br>
A man I guess <br>
I'll never really know.

Goodbye, lad... I'll miss you, <br>
though I don't show it. <br>
I am a farmer of the land, <br>
I'm not a man of words. <br>
Forgive me my failing, <br>
you never knew me. <br>
Godspeed wherever you may go...

So fare thee well, <br>
Remember me... <br>

<h3>Send Home the Slates</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>

<P>
I work for the Union Pike,<br>
out on the Western Line.<br>
I found Uncle Sean in Denver,<br>
and he and his wife are fine.<br>
They send their best,<br>
and like the rest -<br>
they send home the slates.
<P>
It took six months from the Cobh,<br>
another six by land,<br>
but the pay is good,<br>
and as I should<br>
I'll send home the slates.
<P>
<ul>
Back on your feet <br>
now lads, <br>
Our time for writing home has passed. <br>
Six miles to spike today, <br>
that's what we need.
<P>
So fast lads <br>
we must advance, <br>
Work to the Gandy dance. <br>
Six days to double pay, <br>
that's our reward - <br>
But not 'til the line goes down.
</ul>
<P>
I'll not send empty letters,<br>
I know you need the rent.<br>
Dad, you deserve a new pair of boots,<br>
I know it's money well spent.<br>
So kind regards,<br>
I'll work hard -<br>
to send home the slates.
<P>
PS. Dear Ma, <br>
I send my picture.<br>
Don't let the family forget me...

<h3>Watching the Bobbins</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>

<P>
Watching the bobbins, <br>
go up and down. <br>
Fine Irish linen <br>
for a ladies gown.
<P>
One shirt a penny, <br>
seven in a tag; <br>
ten hours a day<br>
and her heart begins to drag.<br>
<P>
This never ending cycle goes on. <br>
But she promised she would never stay... <br>
for long.
<P>
Rocking the treadle, <br>
ache in her soul. <br>
She keeps the rhythm <br>
and it takes a toll.
<P>
Threading the needle,<br>
strains in her eyes.<br>
Old withered fingers<br>
steal her young girl's pride
<P>
She's saving every penny she earns,<br>
because the passion for her freedom<br>
still burns.

<h3>Last Eyes of Ireland</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>

<P>
Listen now boys, <br>
my grandmother said - <br>
I'll tell you a story and <br>
then off to bed. <br>
There once was a time, <br>
we lived off the land. <br>
Harvest would come, <br>
and we all lent a hand
<P>
But winds blew our lives, <br>
and scattered our seeds. <br>
Changing the landscape, <br>
from flowers to weeds. <br>
See in the graveyard <br>
the families gone. <br>
The grandest of tombstones <br>
carry them on...
<P>
When you sail from the Harbour, <br>
It's your last eyes of Ireland.
<p>
We tended the fire, <br>
and faeries appeased <br>
the flame never died <br>
until we had to leave. <br>
And when we were gone, <br>
the house tumbled down <br>
and covered our footprints, <br>
we'd left on the ground.
<P>
When you sail from the Harbour, <br>
It's your last eyes of Ireland.<br>
<P>
My eyes are now tired <br>
and no longer see. <br>
But visions of Ireland <br>
linger in me.
<P>
So carry your past<br>
in the rooms of your heart <br>
and you'll never he empty <br>
of love when you part
<P>
When you sail from the Harbour, <br>
It's your last eyes of Ireland.
<P>

<h3>End of the Day</h3>
<I>Latimer/Hoover</I>

<P>
Searching for fragments <br>
of old yesterday, <br>
I stand at the edge <br>
of my childhood to find, <br>
I long for the shadows<br>
that danced at the end of the day...
<P>
