<H3>Breathless</H3>
<I>(Latimer/Bardens/Ward)</I>
<P>
She is my first love<BR>
Graceful in all her ways<BR>
Folding the hillside<BR>
Turning the sky from night into day<BR>
She won't fail to take my breath away<BR>
<P>
So soft this silence<BR>
She brings before the dawn<BR>
A time of twilight<BR>
When all the world waits to be reborn<BR>
<P>
Nobody knows her name<BR>
No one knows how she came to be here at all<BR>
Giving her loving<BR>
Hoping to everyone<BR>
<P>
Old as the hills<BR>
Young just like the rising sun over fields<BR>
That lie away beneath her feet<BR>
Ev'ry time we meet<BR>
She takes my breath away<BR>
<P>

<H3>Echoes</H3>
<I>(Latimer/Bardens/Ward)</I>
<P>
Out of the mist rising<BR>
Ten thousand navajo braves<BR>
Shining like golden eagles in flight<BR>
Climbing high on the plains<BR>
<P>
Born of the Earth set free <BR>
To run away with the sun<BR>
So free to sing in tune with the world<BR>
Gladly high on the plains<BR>
<P>
So many moons have flown<BR>
Now all your ghosts dance the long shadows<BR>
War cries that died on your lips<BR>
Echo above the plains<BR>

<H3>Wing and a Prayer</H3>
<I>(Latimer/Bardens)</I>
<P>
High rise blocks out the gloom<BR>
The pavement sticks like glue<BR>
You're getting nowhere<BR>
As you ride on a wing and a prayer<BR>
You're crying out loud<BR>
A face lost in the crowd<BR>
A voice no-one can hear<BR>
You'll get by on a wing and a prayer<BR>
So let it be<BR>
Let the breeze carry you to the sea<BR>
Let the wind take you where it will go<P>

You'd better believe it, lay me where<BR>
(Love is everywhere, risin' me found and out)<BR>
And you can feel it you're halfway there<BR>
(Feels like you're gonna drown)<BR>
Just another lovesong ain't reachin' out no one's there<BR>
(Ain't no big thing)<BR>
Once you got the feelin', make you wanna sing<BR>
Just hold on to a wing and a prayer<P>

Just a little homegrown, lights be<BR>
(Lots of smoke in the air)<BR>
Take it or leave it, it comes all for free<BR>
(You'll slowly slip away)<BR>
Just another love song ain't no big thing<BR>
(All senses prevail)<BR>
Once you get the feelin', makes you wanna sing<BR>
You'll fly home on a wing and a prayer
So let it be<BR>
Let the breeze carry you to the sea<BR>
Let the wind take you where it will go<P>

(Now you wonder how why)<BR>
You better believe it, love is everywhere<BR>
You can feel it, you're halfway there<BR>
Just another love song, ain't no big thing<BR>
(You can fly everywhere)<BR>
Once you got the feelin', makes you wanna sing<BR>
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
So let it be<BR>
Let the breeze carry you to the sea<BR>
Let the wind take you where it will go<P>

Just another love song, ain't no big thing<BR>
Once you got the feelin', make you wanna sing<BR>
Just another homegrown, there's lots of things<BR>
Take it or leave it, it comes all for free<BR>
If you trust to a wing and a prayer<p>

You better believe it, love is everywhere<BR>
You can feel it, you're halfway there<BR>
Just another love song, ain't no big thing<BR>
Once you got the feelin', make you wanna sing<BR>
If you trust to a wing and a prayer<p>

<a name="Down on the Farm"></a>
<H3>Down on the Farm</H3>
<I>(Sinclair)</I>
<P>
Every Sunday morning, before daybreak<BR>
Down upon the farm, on the fishpond<BR>
All the little ducks, they go paddling<BR>
Look out goldfish your for breakfast<BR>
<P>
Sunday morning hear the churchbells ringing<BR>
High up in the trees the birds were singing
In the dewey grass spiders spinning<BR>
Rooster calls and cocks his doodle<br>
All around the farm animals stirring<BR>
Through the morning mist the bulls are beefing<BR>
In the grassy meadows cows are munching<BR>
Daisy Bell it's time for milking<BR>
<P>
There's such a lot to be done on the farm<BR>
In the sunshine, and when it's lunchtime<BR>
It's hop down the pub for a pint<BR>
Back on the tractor to finish the plowing<BR>
<P>
Standing all alone, Fred the scarecrow<BR>
Hasn't got a clue how the wheat grows<BR>
Doesn't mind the rain, hates the cold though<BR>
Specially when those icewinds blow snow<BR>
<P>
All along the lane, bees are buzzing<BR>
Little furry things in hedgerows scurrying<BR>
In amongst the corn the bunnies are bouncing<BR>
Must have springs upon their feet<BR>
<P>
Behind the cowshed<BR>
The plowman is taking a peek<BR>
At the farmer's daughter<BR>
Who's hanging her undies in the sun<BR>
<P>
Better get on your boots and join us<BR>
Down on the farm<BR>
<P>
Down here on the farm
<P>
It's a lovely day for country walking<BR>
The vicar's on his bike, Billy's skateboarding<BR>
The farmer and his dog out back shooting<BR>
The gun goes off and hits the tweeting <i>(or: its stopped tweeting)</i><BR>
<P>
Lots of smelly stinks around the farmyard<BR>
Great big pile of sh..t behind the rhubarb<BR>
Sitting in his pram, baby bunting<BR>
Does a *BURP* and starts his grunting<BR>
<P>
Give him a drink, he's gone pink<BR>
Wants his mummy, needs changing I think<BR>
Such a lot can be done on the farm<BR>
In the sunshine<BR>
And when it's lunchtime<BR>
It's hop down the pub for a pint<BR>
Sneak out the backway with Nelly the barmaid<BR>
To the woods<BR>
<P>

<a name="Starlight Ride"></a>
<H3>Starlight Ride</H3>
<I>(Latimer/Bardens)</I>
<P>
There's a road that I must go<BR>
There are short cuts that I know<BR>
But I know that we'll make it eventually<BR>
On a starlight ride<BR>
<P>
There's a fire down below<BR>
(that remains in me)<br>
When the chilly winds will blow<BR>
(it will comfort me)<br>
But as long as we let all our feelings show<BR>
It will never die<BR>
<P>
Feel the magic in the air<BR>
(On a summer night)<BR>
See the road ahead is clear<BR>
(Not a soul in sight)
Let's take every moment and drink it down<BR>
Like a mellow wine<BR>
<P>
In the slipstream of the night<BR>
(I hear music play)<br>
Though its road is crystal bright<BR>
(Seems so far away)<BR>
And it leads us from here to forevermore<BR>
On a starlight ride<BR>
<P>

<a name="Summer Lightning"></a>
<H3>Summer Lightning</H3>
<I>(Latimer/Sinclair)</I>
<P>
Here's that feeling once again<BR>
Across the room you turn and then<BR>
Smile - I've known that smile before<BR>
Yes we've been friends for sure<BR>
Dreams and memories so clear<BR>
Share the love that we once had<BR>
Let the music carry on<BR>
Keep on dancing<BR>
<P>
Summer nights - here on that shoreline<BR>
Meet again - and drink that wine <BR>
This old wine - still thinking of you<BR> 
Missing all the things you do<BR>
<P>
Here in the falling rain<BR>
Once again we play love's game<BR>
Keep on dancing<BR>
<P>
You cast that magic<BR>
Déjà-vu - it's in your stars<BR>
They reveal - you know the answer<BR>
They are true - so for a while<BR>
<P>
Let's renew all those lovers' ties<BR>
Summer lightning in your eyes<BR>
It keeps on dancing<BR>
<P>
I've always known love<BR>
Would return to lighten the darkest day<BR>
We will meet again<BR>
Further on in later lifetime<BR>
Past the skyline, I'll always be your friend<BR>
Send my love to you<BR>
There'll be no sad goodbyes<BR>
<P>

<a name="You Make Me Smile"></a>
<H3>You Make Me Smile</H3>
<I>(Latimer, Bardens)</I><P>
I was looking for an easy ride<BR>
Never wanting to get inside<BR>
Now I know I'm letting go of my defenses<BR>
and cold hard lines<BR>
Because you've shown me there's better times<BR>
Changin' my life in so many ways<P>

I love you<BR>
Because you make me smile<BR>
Just like the morning sun<BR>
You make me smile<BR>
You know you make me smile<BR>
So many ways at once<BR>
Ah you make me smile<P>

Why this feeling never came before<BR>
The answer to that I'm not quite sure<BR>
Maybe time will help this rhyme<BR>
All I know is I'm different now<BR>
You make me happy<BR>
And you're someone always there<BR>
You understand to I'm just a man and...<P>

<a name="Rainbow's End"></a>
<H3>Rainbow's End</H3>
<I>(Latimer, Bardens)</I><P>
We began by sharing more together<BR>
Black against white made it alright<BR>
But things are different now, we've grown apart<BR>
So it's ok, call it a day<BR>
What can I say<BR>
Let's just remember what we had<BR>
Keep on looking for that rainbow<BR>
Rainbow's end<BR>
And when you find that rainbow<BR>
Start again<P>

I know now that it all seems wrong<BR>
But we had no choice<BR>
Change is a thing we can't avoid<BR>
And even though we're singing different songs<BR>
Love still lasts, time will pass<BR>
You and I will always get by<BR>
So keep on looking for that rainbow<BR>
Rainbow's end<BR>
And when you find the rainbow<BR>
Start again<P>

So keep on looking for that rainbow<BR>
Start again<BR>
I hope you find the rainbow<BR>
Rainbow's end<P>
