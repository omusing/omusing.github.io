<h3>Go West</h3>
<P>
It was the very edge of summer<BR>
the air was thin the sky more pale<BR>
Dusty roads I remember<BR>
Oh so well...
<P>
The winds of future blew around us<BR>
The owners came to tell their tale, <BR>
feelin' like a piece of paper <BR>
in a gale.
<P>
Go West, go West. <BR>
where there's fruit in every place <BR>
a smile on every face... <BR>
Go West, go West... <BR>
Where there's work (so I'm told)
<P>
California's never cold, <BR>
so Go West...
<P>
We sold part' our lives <BR>
for 18 dollars... <BR>
Bought a Hudson Super-6 <BR>
Travelled on down the highway <BR>
with no rest...
<P>
Childhood memories behind us <BR>
Grown-up feelings lie ahead, <BR>
Asked my Dad why we're going <BR>
and he said...
<P>
Go West, Go West<BR>
Where there's fruit in every place<BR>
a smile on every face...<BR>
Go West, Go West...<BR>
Where there's work (so I'm told)<BR>
California's never cold... so,<BR>
Go West...

<h3>Mother Road</h3>

<P>
You've made your decision to leave <BR>
there's no turning 'round. <BR>
Now that you've got a reprieve, <BR>
you must stand your ground. <BR>
Some of the others are weak, <BR>
so you must be strong <BR>
$155 won't last very long...
<P>
Ma, will we make out, <BR>
do you think that this old car <BR>
will last?<BR>
Pa, is there some doubt, <BR>
if our bad luck will <BR>
stay in the past?
<P>
Well I'm hoping it's so, <BR>
but you can't really know til the end.<BR>
They tell me that all things must change <BR>
but they begin again.<BR>
Listen to the motor and the road <BR>
and how does it feel? <BR>
Listen with your ears and your hands <BR>
on the steering wheel.
<P>
Ma, will we make out, <BR>
do you think that this old car will last? <BR>
Pa, is there some doubt, <BR>
if our bad luck will stay in the past?
<P>
Listen now boys, <BR>
what your ma has told you <BR>
there is no way we can tell... <BR>
We've got to face this road together <BR>
and have some faith <BR>
in ourselves.
<P>
Ma, will we make out, <BR>
do you think that this old car will last?<BR>
Pa, is there some doubt, <BR>
if our bad luck will <BR>
stay in the past?
<P>
Ma,<BR>
Will we make out...?

<h3>Rose of Sharon</h3>


<P>
Love, are you awake or are you sleeping? <BR>
I'm so excited I could die... <BR>
starting out our lives.<BR>
Must make some plans for the future <BR>
now we need to settle down... <BR>
make a home our own.<BR>

<P>
What we gonna do when the baby comes? <BR>
It won't be long.
<P>
<table width="500" cellpadding=0 cellpadding=0><tr>
<td width=60% valign=top>
Love, am I awake or am I dreaming?<BR>
I'm so excited I could cry.<BR>
At times I'm so afraid.<BR>
Say you'll get a job<BR>
and never leave us...<BR>
Though I know you'll make it right,<BR>
Find a better life.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
What we gonna do when the baby comes? <BR>
It won't be long.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Don't you ever go, <BR>
say you'll never leave <BR>
Promise you won't ever leave.<p>

Don't leave me, <BR>
We need you.<br>

I will try to settle down but<BR>
I can't tell the future<BR>
Rose<BR>
I will try to stay around but<BR>
I don't know the future<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Oh Rose, <BR>
you'll never know, <BR>
just how much I need <BR>
you so.<p>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Oh Rose, you'll never see<br>
Just how much you mean <BR>
to me
<P>
But Rose, <BR>
This road is so hard and long <BR>
and I just can't say.

<h3>End of the Line</h3>

<P>
Well I'm walking this lonely street <BR>
but I'm far from bein' alone <BR>
'Cause everyone I meet, <BR>
has nowhere to call home. <BR>
So they move on<BR>
from day to day, <BR>
just to stand in a line.
<P>
Well my mother she comes to me <BR>
and begs me not to fight. <BR>
For the sake of the family, <BR>
I have to stay out of sight. <BR>
So I move on<BR>
from day to day, <BR>
just to stand in a line.
<P>
On the road again <BR>
for a job I never find. <BR>
People talking... <BR>
as if we're not their kind. <BR>
I got a handbill, <BR>
says there's work up here. <BR>
Left my homeland... <BR>
and paid a price too dear.
<P>
I've come to the end of the line <BR>
there's too many men, <BR>
despair in their faces... <BR>
Each one of us hoping to find a life, <BR>
a home, a dream... <BR>
within the line.
<P>
I ain't helpless --<BR>
I just need a hand.<BR>
These are hard times,<BR>
for every kind of man.<BR>

<P>
I've come to the end of the line <BR>
there's too many men, <BR>
despair in their faces. <BR>
Each one of us hoping to find <BR>
a life, a home, a dream <BR>
a place to be.
<P>
(repeat)
