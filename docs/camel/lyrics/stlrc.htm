<h3>In the Arms of Dancing Frauleins</h3>
<p>
I remember a place we would go<br>
where love was an easy prey.<br>
And through the war I tried to forget<br>
dancing the dark away.<br>
But days of old<br>
are still retold<br>
by lovers from the past.<br>
<br>
In the arms of Waltzing Frauleins<br>
I could forget without regret.<br>
In the arms of Waltzing Frauleins<br>
I'd forget.<br>

<h3>Refugee</h3>
<p>
There's a rumor flying through the air;<br>
Paranoia's creeping everywhere.<br>
You're gonna raise a wall -<br>
to draw the line.<br>
<p>
You say you've got your reasons<br>
I hear them all the time<br>
You say it's talking treason<br>
and a crime...<br>
to question why.<br>
<p>
Don't you know I've seen this all before?<br>
History repeats itself once more.<br>
I don't want to go - <br>
and I can't stay.<br>
<p>
You say you've got your reasons<br>
I hear them all the time.<br>
You say it's talking treason<br>
and a crime...<br>
to question why.<br>
<p>
I don't want to be a refugee,<br>
I just want a single guarantee.<br>
I don't want to be a refugee,<br>
I just want the right to disagree.<br>

<h3>Vopos</h3>
<p>
They woke you in the night<br>
a glare from bright headlights.<br>
Sentry's in a row,<br>
you watched them from a front window.<br>
Through sleepy eyes you saw the scene,<br>
and felt<br>
as if a dream...<br>
had come to life.<br>
<p>
Caught by surprise<br>
protection in disguise.<br>
A high barricade,<br>
the price too high to pay.<br>
The late-night dancers filled the street,<br>
and stopped<br>
as if a dream...<br>
had come to life<br>
<p>
A wail and a cry,<br>
blue lights flashing by<br>
In shadows of the trees,<br>
a zone runs in between.<br>
The young-boy soldiers filled the streets<br>
and moved<br>
as if a dream...<br>
had come to life.<br>
<p>
Can it be a nightmare?<br>
Will you wake and still be there?<br>
So you try to run,<br>
frightened you're the one<br>
left inside.<br>
<p>

<h3>Cloak and Dagger Man</h3>
<p>
Stepping outside,<br>
there's no turning back.<br>
Looking behind,<br>
there's no turning back.<br>
Nowhere to hide - <br>
watch out for the man in drag;<br>
she's got you tagged!<br>
<p>
Checking all around,<br>
there's no turning back.<br>
Listen for a sound,<br>
there's no turning back.<br>
Keep your head down -<br>
watch out for the go-between!<br>
<p>
The Cloak and Dagger Man<br>
Follows -<br>
Run undercover and<br>
trust in no one you know.<br>
<p>
Watch what you say,<br>
there's no turning back.<br>
Lover's will betray!<br>
Watch out for the promise of...<br>
<p>
(repeat chorus)<br>

<h3>West Berlin</h3>
<p>
Feel a chill in the dark,<br>
twilight falls.<br>
Feel the beat of your heart,<br>
danger calls.<br>
<p>
Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...<br>
<p>
Well I'm planning it out,<br>
day by day.<br>
There's no room for doubt,<br>
just one way.<br>
<p>
Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...<br>
And I'm looking out over West Berlin.<br>
Feeling freer now than I've ever been.<br>
When the sun sets over West Berlin,<br>
I'll be leaving,<br>
I can't come back again.<br>
And I'm looking out over West Berlin,<br>
West Berlin.<br>
<p>
In the flood of the light,<br>
safety will shine.<br>
We'll be high out of sight,<br>
on steel cable line.<br>
<p>
(repeat chorus)<br>
<p>

<h3>Fingertips</h3>
<p>
In the time it takes to laugh,<br>
love can turn the key.<br>
Crystal clear the future lies<br>
and what will be will be.<br>
<p>
Don't hold it back,<br>
take the chance you missed.<br>
Don't hold it back,<br>
fill the emptiness.<br>
<p>
Soon the time to say farewell,<br>
will come with no return.<br>
Older now but wiser from<br>
lessons we have learned.<br>
<p>
Don't hold it back,<br>
take the chance you missed.<br>
Don't hold it back,<br>
fill the emptiness.<br>
<p>
Slip through your fingertips,<br>
Speak from your heart don't let it<br>
Slip through your fingertips,<br>
Search for the feeling in it.<br>
Don't let it -<br>
Slip through your fingertips,<br>
Lost if you leave too late.<br>
All at your fingertips,<br>
Gone if you hesitate.<br>
<p>

<h3>Long Goodbyes</h3>
<p>
Down by the lake<br>
a warm afternoon -<br>
breezes carry children's balloons.<br>
Once upon a time,<br>
not long ago,<br>
she lived in a house by the grove.<br>
And she recalls the day,<br>
when she left home...<br>
<p>
Long good-byes,<br>
make me so sad.<br>
I have to leave right now.<br>
And though I hate to go,<br>
I know it's for the better.<br>
Long good-byes,<br>
make me so sad.<br>
Forgive my leaving now.<br>
You know I'll miss you so<br>
and days we spent together.<br>
<p>
Long in the day<br>
moon on the rise -<br>
she sighs with a smile in her eyes.<br>
In the park,<br>
it's late afterall,<br>
she sits and stares at the wall.<br>
And she recalls the day,<br>
when she left home...<br>
<p>
(repeat chorus)<br>
