Jokes and puns from the sleeve notes of Camel albums...

<dt><h4>Andy Ward playing Body Mist on <B><I>Mirage</I></B></h4>
<dd>It's actually a spray can of body deodorant.  Andy used it in
the studio as the 'pfft' sounds on <I>Supertwister</I>.  Andrew Latimer says it was the
smelliest session they ever did.

<DT><h4>Ginseng provided by Allen Mason on <I><B>The Snow Goose</B></I></h4>
<DD>Problems at such early ages? Well, no. Just a play on words:
Allen Mason worked for the <u>Janus</u> Records, who released <B>Camel</B>'s LPs in the US.  'Ginseng' just sounds like 'Janus'. It was just a clever way to thank him. I guess it was also used in Mirage: 'Special thanks ... also to Geoff Jukes and the <u>Gemini</u> kids.

<DT><h4>The Breathless Tour</h4>
<dd>...found <B>Camel</B> as a six-piece, with Dave & Richard Sinclair and Jan Schelhaas from <B>Caravan</B>. In the tour program Latimer is quoted: "...At one stage I did think of calling the band
Caramel!"

<dt><H4>The <B><I>I Can See Your House From Here</I></B> cover issue.</H4>
<dd>Here's a vulgar joke that was probably the basis for the album title:
<ul>"Jesus, on the cross, in his waning moments of life, calls to the crowd below,
'Peter!'  The apostle Peter hears the call and moves closer to his liege. 'Yes,
my Lord, he says.  Jesus calls again, 'Peter!'  Peter approaches the base of the
cross, 'Yes my Lord, it is Peter, I am here for you what do you need?'  Jesus
calls, 'Come closer Peter.'  Peter is beside himself, wondering what the son of
God might have to say to him alone...  He climbs the cross.  Jesus calls 'Peter,
come closer.'  Peter replies that he is coming.  At last, Peter reaches Jesus on
the cross, and says, 'I am here my Lord, what can I do?'  Jesus says 'Peter?
Peter? Is that you Peter?'  'Yes my Lord, I am here for you.'  Jesus says
'Peter, I can see your house from here....' "</ul> (Submitted by Jeff Gebhardt). Susan Hoover mentioned 
the original version co-starred Virgin Mary instead of Peter.

<DT><h4>"Thank heavens Mickey can play with his feet" on <I><B>Never Let Go</B></I></h4>
<DD>Susan Hoover explains:
"Mickey didn't really play any foot pedals (Colin played bass pedals). He just
kind of looked like it on stage."
(referring to
the rich sound of <I><B>Dust and Dreams</B></I> performed by only a four-piece)<P>
