<i>Sure: Camel, Metallica, Alice in Chains, Megadeth, all sounds the same
to me :-). </i>
</ul>
<b>B.T.</b> commented:

<i>Like, wow, Dude.......I just fragged onto this moshing group called "Camel
in Chains"?  They shred, man!  They've got some wicked tunes, Dude; talk
about heavy!!  "Smoke on the Spirit of the Water" rocks, man.........!</i>

This was followed by <b>Tim Miller's</b> opinion:
<ul>
<i>don't forget their landmark album, "Slam Dances", or hit tunes like "Rhayader
Goes to Hell"</i>
