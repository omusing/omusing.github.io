Thanks to all who have informed us of the many bootlegs that are presently circulating. Obviously, we're not too happy about this and to combat it, we are offering our own "official" CAMEL bootleg - <I>Camel On The Road, 1972</I>, a small collection of the band's repertoire from nearly 20 years ago featuring the original line-up. Our way of beating the bootleggers is to undercut them and offer it cheap!

<tr><td align=center bgcolor="#000000"><font color="ffffff">POSTAGE</font></td></tr>
<tr><td>
All our prices are inclusive of postage and packing to simplify matters. However, we have discovered that surface post (3rd class) can now take up to 10 weeks! Air mail postage for international deliveries is not figured into the prices we're charging. Therefore, we must ask that if you want airmail, please add 15% to the TOTAL of your purchases. Otherwise, all orders will be sent 3rd class. Prices for the US are different and this is due strictly to the disparity in postage, but we've adjusted the prices for the CD's and so they are slightly lower making all the prices equal.

<tr><td>
Camel Productions do not have rights to any of the back catalogue EXCEPT the very first CAMEL album originally from MCA Records. We are thrilled to at last be able to offer this for the first time on CD. It took considerable negotiation and there was concern that the master tape would not be transferable as it has been untouched for the 18 years since it's first release. Happily, Andrew Latimer found it in good enough shape to re-master for CD replication and he took great care to try to keep it as close to the original sound as possible.

We have a few things left over from past tours. As they are limited, we ask that you state your preference but if we're out of stock, please accept what's available.

<tr><td>
Thank you for all the wonderful cards and letters we've received since the release of <I>Dust and Dreams</I>. We aren't charging for the newsletter because we will only send one out when there is something to offer or of special interest. So if you don't hear anything for awhile, do not worry. But be sure to stay in touch if you move because it is through your support, encouragement and enthusiasm that we have been able to at last take control and be our own 'record company'. We couldn't have done it without you.
