Following the success of their fourth album, <b><i>Moonmadness</i></b> (UK: Decca
TXS-R 115; Rel.: 26th March 1976; US: Janus 7024), <b>Camel</b> experienced the
first personnel amendment since their formation back in 1971. Andrew
Latimer (Electric, Acoustic and Slide Guitars, Flute, Vocals); Peter
Bardens (Keyboards) and Andy Ward (Drums, Vibes, Varispeed Percussion)
bid farewell to their bass player, Doug Ferguson, following that album's
attendant tours, and while he went off to pursue other interests they
considered how to plug the gap and set to work on formulating ideas for
their next project.
<p>
Andy had not been excessively happy about the fact the heavy road
commitments forced <B><I>Moonmadness</I></B>'s creation to be squeezed into some
three weeks, with about the same time again remaining for rehearsals, so
any enforced delay in transferring anything further to magnetic oxide
caused by Doug's departure naturally meant greater creative time for
preparation. It was not wasted.
<p>
Discussions between the remaining trio about how to cure their immediate
headcount problem though decreed one Richard Sinclair top of the wants
list. A founder member of <B>Caravan</B> and, latterly, leading light in
<B>Hatfield & The North</B>, the gentleman described glowingly in a Melody
Maker article of the era as 'one of the few rock singers who can
actually sing', was contacted with a view to possible recruitment. It
goes without saying he was also a wizard on the amplified four-string to
boot.
<p>
During the months since <B>Hatfield</B>'s demise, Canterbury, Kent's-finest had
initially taken a few weeks well deserved holiday abroad and the
returned to England and set himself up in business making musical
equipment, maintaining playing links with matters melodic by gigging
locally and even forming for fun a one-off band called Sinclair & The
South. When the telephone call came with an offer to join <b>Camel</b> for
recording purposes though he required no second bidding, and checked in,
guitar in hand, during February '77.
<p>
Sinclair settled into his role with a relish over the seven months spent
in the studio as they taped album number five, and it became obvious to
all concerned that here was a rather more permanent solution to filling
their vacancy than anyone had even dared hope. As things progressed he
automatically involved himself in writing and definitely brought a new
dimension to the band's crotcheted horizons and sound, as Latimer was
quick to appreciate when discussing <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b> after its completion:
'It was probably a reaction against <B><I>Moonmadness</I></B>, but we wanted to do
more concise material, and we also wanted to get into jazzier areas.
Richard could play all the jazzy things we wanted - and some of them
were quite complex.' Speaking, as they were, at the very height of the
punk rock revolution, Peter added: 'It's a very optimistic album
compared with much of the material that is being released at the moment.
We've branched out into different directions ranging from jazz to
classical, yet <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b> is more accessible than any of its
predecessors. I suppose it's just a logical progression', adding
enthusiastically, 'Richard has really fitted in perfectly, his voice
enhances <b>Camel</b>'s music.'
<p>
Mr. Sinclair was not alone in adding instrumentation though, since top
saxophonist Mel Collins also fleshed out proceedings and declared
himself ready, willing and able to augment the quartet on their
inevitable supporting tour.
<p>
With everybody delighted at results achieved, that which had been
christened after Messrs. Latimer and Bardens' closing opus debuted in
Britain as TXS-R 124 early in September '77, a single <I>Highways of the
Sun</I> in edited form, backed with an untouched <I>Tell me</I>, also from the
set, gracing dealers' release sheets as F-R 13729 on the 23rd of the
month.
<p>
The 45 didn't dent our Top 50 despite being decidedly radio-friendly,
but <b>Camel</b> had never courted that market anyway and were already residing
on its album relative, for <B><I>Rain Dances</I></B> breezed into the published
best-sellers on September 17th and took an 8-week tenancy as it peaked
at 20 with the sold-out British tour in full swing. An exhausting
pilgrimage around mainland Europe followed. Across the 'big pond', Janus
did not this time offer a seven-inch taster as they had for
<B><I>Moonmadness</I></B> but watched gleefully as their latest nine-track
acquisition, accorded catalogue reference 7035, nudged into Billboard's
Top 200 on November 12th and pushed up to 136 during a 5 week stay.
<p>
For transfer to Compact Disc <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b>' original contents is now
augmented by suffixing that truncated <I>Highways of the Sun</I> variation,
which should hopefully delight anyone replacing their vinyl collection
by helping to keep your <b>Camel</b> libraries complete, though way-back-when
our heroes were already tentatively turning their thoughts towards
whatever might come next, although from certain events of late it was
perceived by those close to the band, and not least by Andy Latimer and
Pete Bardens themselves, that each definitely saw <b>Camel</b>'s future travels
venturing along somewhat different, incompatible paths.
<p>
Something, or rather somebody, would have to give seemingly, but any
such 'storm clouds' were early in 1978 still only a shadow on the
horizon. While minds were seeking inspiration for a wholly new subject
to tackle, ears, hands and concentration were devoted to the careful
assembly of an in-concert chronicle celebrating their history to date
for home issue in April. Without beating about the bush its direct
billing would state, <B><I>A Live Record</I></B>...
