'What we wanted it to be was more or less a history of the band - it was meant
to be a life history rather than a great sounding live record'. So remembered
<b>Camel</b>'s founding father, guitarist/vocalist Andrew Latimer in 1981 as he
spoke of his group's in-concert double vinyl set of April three years earlier,
the fittingly appellated, <B><I>A Live Record</I></B> (U.K.: Decca DBC-R 7/8).
Indeed, the function for which Andrew and his crewmates - at that time fellow
originals Peter Bardens (Keyboards), Andy Ward (Drums, Vibes, Varispeed
Percussion) and recent reruit Richard Sinclair (Bass, Vocals) - had intended
their 2LP package was admirably fulfilled; that it did sound great was no
more than anyone expected.
<p>
In the <b>Camel</b> discography, the forerunner of that which you now hold in your
hand was sandwiched between the studio sets of new material <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b>
(U.K.: Decca TXS-R 124, Released: September 1977; U.S.: Janus 7035) and
<b><i>Breathless</i></b> (TXS-R 132, 22nd September 1978; Arista 4206), though with the
boys switching labels in the States between that international chart-blessed
brace, <b><i>A Live Record</i></b> seemingly failed to see light of day across the
Atlantic sporting eaither logo. In Britain no single from its contents were
planned or executed, and while it retailed steadily to their ever-growing fan
base, just for once a new <b>Camel</b> experience did not nose its way onto
Britain's weekly published survey of best-selling twelve-inchers.
<p>
The recordings our subjects had collected together came from no less than six
different sessions, with the entire second album given over to October 1975's
complete presentation of <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b>. Taped before a full house at
London's Royal Albert Hall, with Doug Ferguson then still plucking their
electric four-string, <b>Camel</b>'s enchanting tale of Fritha and Rhayader had been
embellished by contributions from The London Symphony Orchestra and its
conductor, David Bedford. Many in the audience that autumn evening had waited
eagerly ever since to relive a special, unforgettable night in their recent
past, and now they could do so whenever they wished.
<p>
The other, opening LP sampled several of <b>Camel</b>'s many other delights,
beginning with <I>Never Let Go</I>, the best-loved opus off their eponymous, debut
album at MCA of February 1973. Very briefly, with another extract from its
about-to-be-launched big brother, <I>Curiosity</I>, <I>Never Let Go</I> had been
available in the United Kingdom as a 45, MUS 1177 (January 1973), and in so
doing had handed <b>Camel</b> the privilege of securing one of MCA's inaugural
stereo single berths ahead of such established U.S. acts at the major as
Brenda Laa, Sonny & Cher and Rick Nelson.
<p>
1976's <B><I>Moonmadness</I></B> spectacular was recognised via <I>Song Within A Song</I> from
a September '77 date at the capital's famed Hammersmith Odeon - now re-named
the Apollo- and, from a month later at Bristol's Colston Hall, <I>Lunar Sea</I>
while October 1977 also yielded <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b>' salute, <I>Skylines</I>, although
this time the students of Leeds University could be held responsible for
enthusiastic background noises.
<p>
Not gifted to one of their own studio extravaganza's, <I>Ligging at Louis'</I>
and, from their Deram premiere and second album overall, <b><i>Mirage</i></b>, <I>Lady
Fantasy</I>, found the Latimer/Bardens/Ward/Ferguson initial <b>Camel</b> line-up in
fine form back in October 1974 as they played the Marquee Club. One of the
most convenient venues in which to preserve a gig for audio posterity, sound
engineer John 'skin' Godenzi, like others before him undertaking a similar
task there, was able to plug his charges directly into the then adjacent
Marquee Studios.
<p>
And there they had it, an applauded taster from each of the five albums
issued to date way-back-when, from <b><I>Camel</I></b> to <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b>, lovingly
assembled at a time when the forthcoming sixth was under construction. As one
of the hardest working and most frequently on-tour outfits of the Seventies
and Eighties - who've recently returned to both concert halls and latter-day
state-of-the-art soundproofed microphoned caverns after a period of tangible
inactivity - what finer reminder could one have of <b>Camel</b> than <I><B>A Live
Record</B></I>?....
