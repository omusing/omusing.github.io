<hr><P>

It was while he was still at school in the mid-Sixties that aspiring drummer
Andy Ward became associated with two former members of <B>John's Children</B>,
pre-Marc Bolan: Geoff McClelland (Guitar, Vocals) and Chris Dawsett
(Keyboards).  This trio, aided and abetted by singing bassist Joey Barnes,
gigged under the name of <B>Misty</B>, or indeed any other identity which on
occasions might take their fancy.
<P>
Barnes soon tired of this activity, however, and was replaced by Doug
Ferguson; the membership being simultaneously expanded to five with the
recruitment of vocalist Wendy Hoyle.
<P>
Work wasn't always easy to come by, but they secured a few playing dates at
local girls schools, supplementing these with infrequent bookings at a
young-set hangout of their locale, The Chuck Wagon in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Although a far cry from the <B>Camel</B> we would all know and love, at least two
of its founder members had made each other's acquaintance.  When <B>Misty</B>
finally evaporated, Ward and Ferguson stayed in touch.
<P>
At around the same time in nearby Guildford, 1949-born native Andrew Latimer
(Guitar, Flute, Vocals) was occupying his time as one quarter of <B>The Phantom
Four</B>, a harmony/blues aggregation completed by Andy's brother Ian (Bass,
Vocals); Alan Butcher (Drums) and Graham Cooper (Keyboards, Vocals).
<P>
It was Ferguson's move to Guildford which provided the opportunity for
history to ensure we would all ultimately be refreshed by a musical ship of
the desert though, and during 1967 Doug and Andy crossed paths.
<P>
Both blues fans, their personalities matched as well as their harmonic
tastes, and so as Andrew was assembling a group to knock out the rhythms he
liked, an invitation to supply the lower four-string register was soon
forthcoming to Doug.  Ferguson made only one proviso: that his friend Andy
Ward handled the percussion department.  Since the ex-Phantom hadn't actually
contacted anyone else about his projected endeavour, Ward was wecomed with
open arms.  Collectively they christened themselves <B>Brew</B>.
<P>
This outfit worked hard, perfomed as often as anyone offered them employment,
and like a million others before and since cut demonstration discs of their
own handiwork.  They once recollected that an album's worth of material was
taped for an enthusiastic German produce, but failed to see the light of day.
<P>
Undismayed <B>Brew</B> continued towards hoped-for recognition, and early in 1971
were contacted by the Dick James Organization who'd been impressed by
material received.  DJM suggested a liaison with a writer/performer
contracted to the, Phillip Goodhand-Tait.  The idea appealed to both parties,
so that season they backed the one-time front man of the Stormsville Shakers
for both live and studio work.
<P>
In the latter category Phillip's long-player I THINK I'LL WRITE A SONG (U.K.:
DJLPS 416, Released: September 1971) resulted, but being a long-term backing
group was hardly utopia for three such talented performers.  They reviewed
their ambitions and possibilities constantly, not knowing that change was
just around the corner.
<P>
Purveyor of entertainment by means of black and white ivories, Peter Bardens
initially expressed himself in 1962 via Hamilton King's Blues Messengers.  A
brief flirtation with a triumvirate of his own was followed by 'professional'
status with The Cheynes (July 1963-April 1965) - where Mick Fleetwood could
be observed rattling the traps.  Van Morrison's brainchild, <B>Them</B>, was next on
the agenda, being superseded by the purely instrumental Peter B's Looners in
February 1966.  A British answer to America's Booker T. (Jones) & The M.G.'s,
they were absorbed a few months later into Shotgun Express.  This hotbed of
future superstars included Fleetwood, Peter Green and Rod Stewart in its
personnel, but by February '67 that party was over.  Bardens then augmented
numerous outfits until constructing another trio of his own design, <B>Village</B>,
in May 1968.  A couple of years later Peter decided he could develop more
positively as a solo artist, evacuated the hamlet and, signing with
Transatlantic Records, issued a pair of LP's.  THE ANSWER (TRA 222, September
1970) was pursued by a self-named package a few months later (TRA 243, July
1971).
<P>
To ply his trade on the road Peter had cobbled together a group he christened
<B>On</B>, but failing to make much impact he discontinued the experiment and
plotted a move to the States.  Dame good fortune ensured that before any ship
sailed or aeroplane flew, however, his eye would light upon an advertisement
in the weekly music publication, Melody Maker.
<P>
Having split from Mr. Goodhand-Tait, <B>Brew</B> had decided the addition of a
keyboard operator would broaden their melodic possibilities and so placed a
few lines in the 'Musicians Wanted' columns.
<P>
Peter auditioned on a Hammond organ the boys had borrowed from a mutual
friend, who was actually co-operating in the hope of filling their vacancy
himself.  It was not to be; the prospective paymasters immediately struck up
a rapport on every level with Bardens and he was invited to part the stool.
<P>
It was the tail-end of 1971 and all concluded that new chapter might best be
heralded by a change of name.  Clearly they would be progressing musically
too, so each man concentrated on thinking up a snappy billing nomenclature.
 In the meantime our quartet crossed the Irish Sea as <B>On</B> to fulfil Peter's
outstanding contractual obligations extant from his last incarnation.  That
it presented a chance to get their latest act together was a bonus.
<P>
Back home again, November witnessed agreement between our protagonists that
they should henceforth be known as <B>Camel</B>, and soon afterwards they celebrated
the event when Walthamstow Polytechnic in London hosted their 'official' set
as support to rock band <B>Wishbone Ash</B>.
<P>
All four musicians were highly proficient and they'd supplemented their
earnings from evenings on the boards through session work, courtesty of an
E.M.I. staff producer who used them often.  Well, three of them anyway.
 Peter was by-passed because this gentleman didn't care for organists.
 Nobody knows why.  That notwithstanding, he introduced the boys to brothers
Mickie and Dave Most - multi-faceted entrepreneurs to the industry.
<P>
In turn they pointed Camel towards the Buffalo Agency's booker, Geoff Jukes,
who was currently preparing his own enterprise.  He signed them to his
fledgling Gemini Company who found them work, and Geoff was asked to become
the band's manager.
<P>
Gigging day in, day out our heroes quietly collected a growing legion of
admirers, including Artistes & Repertoire representatives from several record
companies into the bargain.  MCA won the race, so that by mid-1972 <B>Camel</B> were
in the studio committing their debut album to tape.
<P>
Unfortunately, completion took far longer than anyone wanted or expected.
 The band lacked experience within microphoned portals, as did their rookie
producer, Dave Williams.  In between they kept up a gruelling date diary,
earning their stripes as warm-up for Barclay James Harvest during November
and December.  Reviews were favourable.
<P>
Their eponymously-titled twelve incher finally hit the streets of Britain in
February '73 (MCA MUPS 473), while the band promoted their handiwork on the
road during February and March by opening for labelmates, Stackridge.
<P> 
Although <B><I>Camel</I></B> retailed over 5,000 within twelve months - and would probably
have sold more had the stateside giant not switched U.K. distributors towards
year's end - the Music Corporation of America's British arm declined to take
up their option.
<P>
By now Jukes had formed Gama Records with Richard Thomas and Max Hole.  <B>Camel</B>
inked the dotted line direct to the production company and the business of
taping a second album began.  David Hitchcock filled the producer's role, his
pedigree already including LP's for Genesis and the Canterbury, Kent group,
<B>Caravan</B>, some of whose members whould form alliances with <B>Camel</B> in years to
come, but those are stories for other days . . . 
<P>
Gama sought an outlet for their projects and quickly signed a long-term deal
with Decca/London's off-shoot label, Deram, for the world except Canada and
North America where Janus Records held sway.  The first fruits of this
partnership was to be the vinyl ancestor of the package you now hold in your
hand, <B><I>Mirage</I></B>.  Issued at home as SML 1107 on March 1st 1974, no singles from
it were envisaged, nor did it breach the listings, but general media response
to the finished article was extremely promising.
<P>
'Sounds' for March 30th opened their appreciation by stating, 'You don't
listen to a band like <B>Camel</B> for quick thrills.  You really do have to hear
them a few times before the music begins to register - all those long an
delicately arranged instrumental passages burn slowly, but once the melodies
are in your head, they don't rub out easily.'  Most tracks were essentially
devoid of lyrics, and their reviewer was quick to praise the ability and feel
for their art of those taking part.  Ward and Ferguson were described as a
'well oiled machine.'  <B>Camel</B> themselves were meanwhile preparing for a
pilgrimage to France and Germany throughout April and May.
<P>
Back home the latter month's 'Beat Instrumental' magazine went one better
than Sounds, according <B><I>Mirage</I></B> 'Album Of The Month' status, selecting a few
choice adjectives and encouraging would-be purchasers by closing, 'the
musicianship is excellent, and Camel seem to be one of the few bands who get
the best out of each other and put it into strong and tight music.'  High
praise indeed.
<P>
Whatever disappointment all concerned may have felt at their failure to dent
the LP barometer upon this sceptred isle, or at the lack of radio airplay
from largely singles-orientated broadcasters, spirits were definitely lifted
when on November 30th Janus 7009 entered Uncle Sam's Billboard Top 200.
 There <B><I>Mirage</I></B> remained visible for a creditable 13 weeks, peaking at 149.
 Greatest support for the disc was evident on the West Coast, although nobody
has ever been able to ascertain exactly why that area above all the others.
<P>
<B>Camel</B> returned the compliment our cousins paid by packing their bags and
heading towards the nation where Liberty waits to greet newcomers.  Booked
for a 7 weeks crusade, again with their old friends <B>Wishbone Ash</B> headlining,
Camel's act was aimed fairly and squarely at the audiences who'd pay to watch
with 45 minutes of hard rocking boogie.  It went down like a storm.
<P>
Scheduled to wind up in Miami during December, Geoff Jukes advised the
foursome to stay put and a tour of their own was mapped out.  Lasting 3
months, they played almost every state before making the return Atlantic
crossing for a well-earned break.  Behind them, large numbers of devotees
who'd packed the clubs they played night after night.
<P>
Once home the band discussed at length where their direction lay and what
their third set might consist of.  A specific 'concept' idea had been in
their minds and was soon given the final thumbs-up by all and sundry.  Andy
Latimer and Peter Bardens thus disappeared to a remote Devon cottage for the
purpose of deciding upon subject matter, and then sketching a cleffed
framework.
<P>
Very different in texture to <I><B>Mirage</B></I>, that endeavour would be <I><B>The Snow Goose</B></I>. Its 1975 unveiling would make <B>Camel</B> an internationally known name, rewarding
at llast all those years of struggle . . .
