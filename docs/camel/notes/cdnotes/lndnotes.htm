<B>Camel</B> were a British progressive rock band formed back in 1972 by keyboards
player Peter Bardens who had previously worked with such outfits as <B>Them</B>,
<B>Shotgun Express</B> (alongside Rod Stewart) and <B>Village</B>, as well as recording
several solo albums.  He was joined in his new musical venture by Andy
Latimer (flute, guitar and vocals), Doug Ferguson (bass), and Andy Ward
(drums) who had all previously been in Phil Goodhand-Tait's backing group
<B>Brew</B>.
<P>
Their first album as Camel was released in 1973 but was not a commercial
success.  It was followed by <I><B>Mirage</B></I> in 1974, but their third album <I><B>The Snow
Goose</B></I>, a concept album based on Paul Gallico's The Snow Goose, the popular
children's novel, was the one to elevate them to heights of success.  It
climbed into the British Top 30 album chart and remained there for several
months; within weeks the band were appearing at London's prestigious Royal
Albert hall, performing the album with the London Symphony Orchestra.
<P>
The band had two more Top 20 album sucesses in the Seventies, <I><B>Moonmadness</B></I>
in 1976, and <I><B>Raindances</B></I> in 1977.  Another album, 1978's <I><B>Breathless</B></I>, was a
Top 30 hit.  At the same time the band enjoyed some transatlantic success
with their albums making the lower end of the US charts.
<P>
As with most other bands of the era, <B>Camel</B> underwent several changes in
personnel.  Doug Ferguson left the line-up to be replaced by bassist Richard
Sinclair (formerly with <B>Caravan</B>).  Mel Collins also joined the band as
saxophonist but then Sinclair was replaced by Colin Bass.  The biggest change
came with the departure of founder member Pete Bardens who left to persue
various musical directions including playing with Van Morrison again
(resuming a working relationship first started with <B>Them</B>).
<P>
<B>Camel</B> were very much a Seventies progressive rock band.  Their music was just
right for the time, and they deserved their moments of fame.  Their third
album <I><B>The Snow Goose</B></I> is still a musical landmark of the era, and will
probably still be enjoyed by music fans in the next century.  In the meantime
here's a Nineties reminder of the fine recordings that they produced two
decades ago.
