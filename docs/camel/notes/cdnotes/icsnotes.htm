Their eighth album, and fifth to chart in the United Kingdom, <B><I>I Can See
Your House From Here</I></B>, like its immediate predecessor, <I><B>Breathless</B></I> in
1978, was more a collection of songs rather than the concept package, a
la <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b>, for which <b>Camel</b> has become justifiably famous.
<p>
Of the founding quartet - Andrew Latimer (Guitar, Flute, Vocals); Andy
Ward (Drums, Percussion)); Doug Ferguson (Bass) and Peter Bardens
(Keyboards) - who'd initially pooled their resources late in 1971 to
form this melodic ship of the desert launched officially during the
spring of '71, only the first named pair remained. Doug called it a day
after completing their fourth set (<B><I>Moonmadness</I></B>, 1976), to be replaced
by Richard Sinclair, best-known for his time with the Kent-based
aggregation <B>Caravan</B>. This line-up was then responsible for <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b>
(1977), the double LP history <b><i>A Live Record</i></b> (1978) and finally, later
that same year, <I><B>Breathless</B></I>.
<p>
At this point one half of the band's songwriting duo, Peter Bardens,
decided to pursue an alternative path for the future, but as the boys
were already committed to a promotional tour in support of their latest
handiwork, a replacement had to be recruited and familiarize himself
with <b>Camel</b>'s repertoire forthwith. Richard stepped into the breach by
suggesting his cousin David and/or Jan Schelhaas, variously Caravaner
both, would fit the bill.
<p>
Each man was approached and the response was positive, although Dave
made it clear from the outset that his association would be purely for
the tour fulfillment and no more. Nevertheless, it set the bells ringing
in Mr. Latimer's head, as he revealed in 1981: "I suddenly thought using
two keyboard players would be a great idea because we'd be able to do
many more adventurous things", adding tongue-in-cheek, "At one stage I
did think of calling the band Caramel!"
<p>
The use of erstwhile Caravan personnel was perfectly logical, as both
groups had been moving in similar circles during their respective
careers, being signed to Decca labels. Their sounds also were both
consciously British in content, and the Guildford, Surrey-born
guitarist/leader explained why he intended <b>Camel</b> should remain that way:
"I always wanted to keep the music very English because I didn't feel it
was worth competing with the Americans. At one stage Peter wanted us to
be a Santana-type band, but I believed we should stick to doing what we
did best and not try to copy other peoples music." Clearly Bardens
ultimate departure was an inevitability, but happily an amicable one in
all departments.
<p>
Stability of membership though was not to become a prerequisite again in
the forseeable future, since immediately following the <I><B>Breathless</B></I>
crusade another bomb was dropped - exit Richard Sinclair. Andy Latimer:
"Richard couldn't really cope with our level of touring. We were playing
a lot of concerts, doing around seventy in seventy-eight days. It was
very hard work. And we were playing to a lot of people every night,
houses of around two to three thousand." So what was to happen next?
"That was when we linked with Colin Bass who soon worked out extremely
well. He was a very different player to Richard, very solid."
<p>
Jan Schelhaas who, apart from <B>Caravan</B> had also graced <B>The National Head
Band</B> and Gary Moore's ensemble, remained with the Andys, and since
Latimer wanted to continue with a twin black-and-whites attack, Kit
Watkins from <B>Happy The Man</B> opted to change address.
<p>
Throughout the summer of '79 this new quintet set about penning the
contents of another long-player, continuing the new-broom-sweeps-clean
philosophy by seeking additionally a fresh face to occupy the producer's
role. Rupert Hine received the thumbs-up, a top-notcher whose curriculum
vitae already boasted the satisfied client signatures of such as Kevin
Ayers (<B><I>Confessions of Dr. Dream</I></B>, 1972); Yvonne Elliman (<B><I>Food of Love</I></B>,
1973); Dave Greenslade (<B><I>Cactus Choir</I></B>, 1976); Quantum Jump (<B><I>Quantum
Jump</I></B>, 1976; <I><B>Barracuda</B></I>, 1977) and Cafe Jacques (<I><B>Round the Back</B></I>,
1977; <I><B>International</B></I>, 1978). On top of this he'd also recorded as a
writer/artist himself, notably in 1976 coming up with a marvellously
innovative and unjustifiably neglected vocal 45 entitled <I><B>Snakes Don't
Dance Fast</B></I> (Electric), on which he supplied all the instrumental
accompaniment - reputedly with just his mouth. A man with a commercial
pedigree, <b>Camel</b> had made an interesting choice.
<p>
Through a process of elimination after each participant had exercised
his quill for the common good, nine numbers were shortlisted for
recording, each the solo endeavour or in collaboration via various
permutations, of the individuals named hereafter: Messrs. Latimer, Ward,
Schelhaas, Bass, Watkins, John McBurnie and Viv McAuliffe. But what to
call the harmonic portrait overall?
<p>
There was a rather long-winded joke doing the rounds in England at the
time concerning crucifixion, the punchline of which had the poor
unfortunate nailed to a cross stating to his beckoned observer, "I can
see your house from here." Obviously this jape made an impression on our
heroes sufficiently to be adopted and, plumbing for an outer space theme
adaption for sleeve graphics, found itself registered as the billing for
Taped and mixed at the Farmyard Studios in Little Chalfont with
orchestral overdubs added at London's celebrated A.I.R. establishment,
old friend Mel Collins - a sessioneer for <B>Caravan</B> also - added his
saxophone contributions, while <B>Genesis</B>' legendary drummer/vocalist Phil
Collins- totally unrelated - also dropped by to rattle some traps.
<p>
Latimer was delighted with the end product, as he made emphatically
obvious: "Rupert was great fun to work with, he was really up and zappy.
I enjoyed making that record. We did it rather quickly and it wasn't a
lengthy production."
<p>
Magnetic oxide was delivered to 'The Supreme Record Company', and a
release date scheduled at home for mid-October 1979 as Decca TXS-R 137.
On the 27th of the month it bounced into the charts, lodging twenty-one
days and peaking at No. 45.
<p>
It was decided by the powers-that-be to issue a supporting seven incher
to boost media interest, and it appears that the first choice item was
allocated a catalogue number and then shelved temporarily to make way
for what was felt to be a stronger maxi-single. From the new spectacle
Andy Latimer and Kit Watkins' <I>Remote Romance</I> was edited to form the
'A' side of Decca F-R 13879 (Rel.: 26th October, UK only), while its
lower deck consisted of single version of <I>Rainbow's End</I> from
<I><B>Breathless</B></I> (TXS-R 132, 22nd September 1978) and a <b>Camel</b>/Mick Glossop
production of <I>Tell Me</I>, a number first heard on <b><i>Rain Dances</i></b> (TXS-R
124, September 1977). Sadly, like all such <b>Camel</b> offerings, it failed
to trouble compilers of the weekly best-sellers, but encouraged the
radio play for which it was primarily intended.
<p>
On 29th February 1980 that which had originally been intended as a
inaugural single surfaced, when F-R 13871 called to admirers everywhere,
this time cementing the latest set's <I>Your Love is Stranger than Mine</I>
and <I>Neon Magic</I> back-to-back. While not breaking the mould of that
which had gone before, sales figures were respectable. By their own
admission, however, <b>Camel</b> set out to create anything with the singles
market in mind, but unlike many of their album-orientated
contemporaries, readily accepted their disc outlets' attempts worldwide
to broaden band appeal through the media mainstream as they wished.
<p>
1980, as it turned out, would be the first year since their inception
that our subjects proferred no new LP, for although one was ready for
shipment immediately prior to Christmas that year, it was wisely held
over until January '81 to avoid the possibility of being swamped in the
seasonal rush.
<p>
This latest extravaganza, <B><I>Nude</I></B>, marked a return to a specific concept
ideal, and witnessed the departure of both keyboard practitioners who had
solo ideas waiting to come off the back burners. Duncan Mackay stepped
into the performing spotlight in their absence, although Jan tinkled
the ivories on one track and co-authored another, Watkins also leaving
his pen's impression on a solitary opus. But that tale, dear reader,
belongs to another day. Let us for now savour Chapter Eight of the <b>Camel</b>
story, <b><i>I Can See Your House From Here</i></b>...
