It was <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b>, <b>Camel</b>'s third album, which really established the
British band as a force to be reckoned with. Following their opening
eponymously titled effort for MCA (UK: MUPS 473, February 1973) they'd
signed to production company Gama Records, distributed throughout the
world except North America and Canada by the mighty Decca/London
corporation.
<p>
Added to the organisation's offshoot Deram label artists roster,
<b><i>Mirage</i></b> (UK: SML 1107, March 1974) earned a lot of critical praise.
Stateside this appeared under the Janus banner (7009), as would the next
three LP's also, and thanks to enthusiastic response on the West Coast
particularly, it cracker Billboard's Top 200 chart on November 30th '74.
Remaining for very creditable 13 weeks, <b><i>Mirage</i></b> peaked at 149.
<p>
On the strength of this, <b>Camel</b> picked up a seven week tour of Uncle Sam
as show openers for <B>Wishbone Ash</B>. When that itinerary completed its run
in Miami during December, it was suggested to our boys by their
management that they remain in America and go out on the road alone to
maintain momentum. For the next three months they did just that.
<p>
Although returning home in the meantime, yet another top-billing
pilgrimage reached fruition. Dominating a venue's stage for a week was
the norm this time around, with two shows a night playing to packed
houses. Repertoire though, dominated by boogie numbers apparently, was a
far cry from that which was shortly to follow.
<p>
Back on English soil once more the foursome, Peter Bardens (Organ, Mini
Moog, Electric Piano, Pipe Organ, Acoustic Piano, ARP Odyssey) Andrew
Latimer (Electric, Acoustic and Slide Guitars, Flute, Vocals), Andy Ward
(Drums, Vibes, Varispeed Percussion) and Doug Ferguson (Bass), were
thinking along the lines of a concept album, an idea they'd been toying
with off and on for a couple of years.
<p>
That the inspirational basis for this forthcoming endeavour would
probably be an acclaimed literary piece was not a bone of contention.
Which item it should be was. Steppen Wolf was favoured by Bardens, while
Latimer and Ferguson registered a vote for Paul Gallico's <b><I>Snow Goose</I></b>.
<p>
The group's co-scribes, Andy and Peter, therefore retired to the
solitude of a cottage in Devon to finalise plans. Our guitarists stated
in 1981 that in fact it wasn't until a week into their sabbatical that
the decision to make album number three of the concept variety was
definitely agreed between them. Once bartering and bantering ceased
through, the pair worked furiously, completing the bulk of writing
within a fortnight. Andy Latimer takes up the story: "It was a strange
album in as much as we wrote the whole thing and practised each piece,
but never ever played it all the way through, so we had no real idea
what the overall result would be. But when we heard the finished result
we were chuffed".
<p>
It was originally intended that a narrative thread through this
instrumental pleasantry, and Gama's powers-that-be Geoff Jukes, Max Hole
and Richard Thomas attempted negotiations with Mr. Gallico's book
publishers in the hope of obtaining official blessing for their project,
ideally having the author pen a sleeve note and possibly arrange a
tie-in between the album and tome. Unfortunately for <b>Camel</b>, their
overtures were declined, a similar deal being struck for use of
composer/musician Ed Welch's handiwork featuring
comedian/man-of-many-talents Spike Milligan in a storytelling role. To
minimise conflict therefore, this tribute to our feathered friends had
its title prefaced 'Music Inspired By' and remained wholly wordless.
<p>
The Island recording studios were booked, <b><i>Mirage</i></b>'s producer, David
Hitchcock prepared to reprise his role, and <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b> was in the
can by early 1975 following a few overdubs at 'The Supreme Record
Company's' miked-up complex in West Hampstead. The band were transferred
from Deram to the main Decca label, and SKL-R 5207 was unveiled for the
public in April. May 24th happily saw it breach Britain's Top 50
long-playing best-sellers listing for the first of its 13 weeks on show,
22 becoming the uppermost ascent. The band's faithful and growing
following across the pond ensured that Janus 7016 announced its arrival
come July 19th, after which it pulled up at 162 during a 35 day stop
over. Events were similar elsewhere, and the quartet's name became known
to a considerably wider audience. They could certainly be said to have
arrived.
<p>
Press reviews were not particularly kind to <I>Fritha</I> and <i>Rhayader</I> overally
however, and radio play was hard to obtain - an unsyllabled concept
album being viewed with apparent suspicion by writers and seemingly
confounding programme controllers. Clearly strong, steady sales
indicated eager listeners were not excessively influenced by the media's
thumbs down attitude, but sensibly Decca culled a 45 on May 16th to
support their investment. F-R 13581 coupled the commercial <I>Flight of the
Snow Goose</I> with <I>Rhayader</I>. The group's inaugural single, it would be
one of only four they would issue during their existence. It didn't
trouble chart compilers, but served as the taster it was intended to be.
<p>
Next on the agenda came a promotional road crusade, and <b>Camel</b> decided
Holland should be first to witness their new show. The assembled a two
part concert programme, the latest epic occupying the entire first half.
As it turned out, only part two really received a seal of approval from
the fans, so wisely they returned home to examine possible reasons for
the disinclination towards applause in Act One.
<p>
The concensus of opinion was that since <B><I>Snow Goose</I></B> utilized an orchestra
on disc which was absent live, and thus amended arrangements of the work
had been necessary, certain re-scoring would have to be effected to
improve compensation of sound further than had thus far been achieved.
Eventually satisfied with alterations, they scheduled a brief tour to
try out this latest audio incarnation. It worked beautifully, and the
welcome sounds of clapping hands returned to ring round auditoriums
throughout the entire programme once more.
<p>
One ray of sunshine from the music press around this time found
Britain's long-established weekly, the 'Melody Maker', awarding <b>Camel</b>
their 1975 accolade for 'Brightest Hope', but a crowning achievement was
just around the corner.
<p>
With David Bedford wielding a conductor's baton, <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b> was
performed on stage by the band to an accompaniment from The London
Symphony Orchestra at London's prestigious Royal Albert Hall in October.
It was an enormous success, and a terrific exercise in advertising which
did much to further <b>Camel</b>'s high profile amongst consumers. Another
back-up tour followed, drawing yet more converts into the fold.
<p>
Not content to rest on their laurels, and eager to expand in yet another
harmonic direction, guidelines were sketched for a follow-up twelve
incher. That this new endeavour would feature throat emissions
prominently was clearly paramount; Andy Latimer again recollects events
of the period: "We decided to steer clear of conceptual albums and start
to put more emphasis on the vocals. There was also outside pressure from
the record companies, particularly in the US. I recall a meeting in New
York where they were horrified to find that <I><B>Snow Goose</B></I> had no vocals.
They freaked!"
<p>
Their wish was the boys command, as the saying goes. That fourth
extravaganza would be <I><B>Moonmadness</B></I>, another chapter in the history of
<b>Camel</b>, but no better finale to this episode could be imagined than that
which subsequently occurred. <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b> earned a silver replica of
itself for sales in 1981, and has continued to wing skywards towards
greater heights  ever since. Who say's only Magpies and Jackdaws collect
shiny metal objects to adorn their nests?...
