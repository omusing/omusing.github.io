<center><h2><B><I>Camel (25th Anniversary)</I></B> Liner Notes</h2></center>
<hr>
<B>Disclaimer: These Liner Notes are taken from the Deram release of Camel's CDs. They are published here
without permission. The original CD booklets includes pictures and info which is not
available here, therefore I strongly recommend buying them.</B>
<hr><P>
Incredibly, as I pen this note, <B>Camel</B> have been entertaining us for a
quarter of a century.
<P>
Albeit that the line-up has inevitably changed during that time, they have
just undertaken yet another acclaimed world tour that packed concert halls
around the globe, yet there is undoubtedly a warm feeling of being a member
of one giant family as a <B>Camel</B> fan.  Wherever you go, seemingly, it is
impossible not to discover fellow enthusiasts, and as the individual who
has revelled in the privilege during this last decade of overseeing the
transfer of much of their catalogue to Compact Disc, I've had the rare
pleasure of probably communicating with more than most and various band
members too.
<P>
Perhaps part of the secret is that <B>Camel</B>'s participants past and present
genuinely respect their admirers and respond to them.  Love is a two-way
thing, y'know  ...
<P>
Guitarist / vocalist and song writer supreme Andrew Latimer remains the
heart of <B>Camel</B>, as he has always been, and he's travelled a long road since
the early l970s when the band's Mk. 1 model rolled off  the production
line, completed by Peter Bardens (Keyboards), Doug Ferguson (Bass) and Andy
Ward (Drums).
<P>
The quartet were soon added to the U.K. arm of a major American record
company's artist roster following a string of healthy auditorium receptions
during support slots on the road for first <B>Barclay James Harvest</B> and, a
little later, <B>Stackridge</B>, but what appeared a glittering start lost much of
its sparkle as their debut album called, fittingly enough, <B><I>Camel</I></B>, fell
victim to its label's untimely international distribution switch.  Sales
and momentum were lost.
<P>
Late in 1973, however, they joined British Decca - who'd initially handled
their first LP - and so began a lengthy relationship that spawned numerous
best-sellers. It is from that treasured archive that we've drawn together
this collection of choice cuts, including a handful of titles the versions
of which featured here have only previously been available on that relative
rarity, a <B>Camel</B> seven-inch vinyl 45.
<P>
<B><I>Mirage</I></B> was the long-player that christened the partnership in March '74,
and it  curried favour particularly with residents of Uncle Sam's West
Coast - sample <I>Supertwister</I> to find out why - though a somewhat different
sounding musical tribute to novelist Paul Gallico's <B><I>The Snow Goose</I></B>, set
free in May the next year, was the project which indelibly rubber-stamped
their arrival as a force to be reckoned with.
<P>
Finding space on published charts in several countries, this delightful
work heralded the advent of Camel's 'golden years', providing healthy
amounts of music media interest and such prestigious opportunities as an
offer to perform <B><I>Snow Goose</I></B> live at England's world famous Royal Albert
Hall with The London Symphony Orchestra and conductor David Bedford. 
You'll not be surprised to learn they accepted.
<P>
A greater emphasis on vocals began with 1976's <B><I>Moonmadness</I></B> and the first
personnel amendment took place shortly afterwards, bassist Ferguson being
replaced by <B>Caravan</B>'s Richard Sinclair who then contributed fully to the
jazzier <B><I>Rain Dances</I></B> (September 1977).
<P>
Spring '78 brought forth a double in-concert set which highligted <B>Camel</B>'s
achievements to date - <B><I>A Live Record</I></B> - while the autumn's new studio album
was <B><I>Breathless</I></B>. lt would be Peter Bardens' last.
<P>
With a tour imminent, <B>Caravan</B> again supplied some fine substitutes and two
keyboarders joined our ship of the desert to broaden their aural
possibilities.  Applause please for Richard Sinclair's cousin David and Jan
Schelhaas, although both Sinclairs bid adieu before October 1979's <B><I>I Can See Your
House From Here</I></B>.
<P>
A retum to the concept arena was undertaken via January '81's <B><I>Nude</I></B>, based
on lyricist Susan Hoover's theme of a solitary Japanese soldier trapped on
an  island for over thirty years, believing World War II to be still
extant, after which Gold Discs a-plenty arrived for sales of <B><I>The Snow Goose</I></B>
and <B><I>Chameleon - The Best Of Camel</I></B> provided a tasty titbit for new converts
educating themselves about events so far.
<P>
Sadly, personal circumstances caused drummer Ward's permanent departure in
1981, leaving Andrew Latimer the sole founder member in situ for '82's <B><I>The
Single Factor</I></B> - although Pete Bardens guested on one track - and various
other commitments meant the musical chairs continued before 1984's superbly
atmospheric <B><I>Stationary Traveller</I></B> pulled into view.  You'll get the mood 
here from <I>Cloak and Dagger Man</I> and the enchantingly thought-provoking
<I>Fingertips</I> (hesitant would-be lovers, listen carefully). lt is also where
we take out leave from the band's chronology.
<P>
<B>Camel</B>'s final Decca album was another live extravaganza issued in November
that year, <B><I>Pressure Points</I></B>, following which Andrew settled in America and
he and Susan formed their own company, Camel Productions, that has released
all subsequent albums by our heroes.
<P>
Written history lesson over.  Please hit 'Play' and let your ears
celebrate.  They'll be eternally grateful...
