Mr. John Tracy of the Decca label has written detailed liner notes for the DERAM CD releases of <b><b>Camel</b></b>'s albums. The liner notes shed light over the band's history. Unfortunately these notes are unavailable on the London or OneWay CD releases. The original CD work on the DERAM releases also
feature additional photoes and info, and I strongly recommend them.
<p>
The Liner notes collection was begun a few years ago; Some other people and U have typed in some of them and sent them to each other via e-mail. I have lately received new additions from Greg Chudov, Stan Rosenthal Magnus Eneskar and Genis Parra. Thanks!

At the current situation these notes are reprinted without permission, apart for <B><I>Echoes</I></B>.

<h3>Camel Family Tree</h3>
A Family Tree of the band was created by Pete Frame and submitted by Theo Kamps. I think it was available along with the 1979 "I Can See Your House From Here" tour program.<br>
You can download the tree in two formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="images/tree-visual.gif">Viewable Format</a> - a large (490K) image which you can view within your browser.
<li><a href="images/tree-print.gif">Printable Format</a> - a larger (yet only 420K) image which you should save to your disk and print - possibly using an external software (such as ACDSee or MS-Word).
</ul>
Here is a complete (yet unreadable) view of the tree:<br>
