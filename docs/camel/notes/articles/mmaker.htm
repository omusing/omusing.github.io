In 1976, discussing the use of lights and films during his band
Camel's performances, guitarist and vocalist Andrew Latimer told Melody
Maker, "This is the first time we've used films, and I don't want us to
get into it too much. ...We're not a very bopping band, so it's nice for
the audience to have something to watch."<P>
The British progressive rock group Camel formed in 1972 when the
blues-rock trio Brew, consisting of Latimer, bassist Doug Ferguson, and
drummer Andy Ward.  After backing singer Philip Goodhand-Tait on an
album, the trio was joined by organist and vocalist Peter Bardens and
began rehearsing original material.<P>
Camel's sound featured extensive interplay between Latimer's
guitar and Bardens's keyboards, underpinned by Ward's swinging
percussion.  Vocals were not the band's main focus.  During the recording
of Camel's debut album, the producer suggested that the group find a
better singer.  After auditioning 30 unsuitable vocalists, the search was
abandoned and the recording sessions continued.<P>
The band became a fixture on the English college circuit.  In a
1973 interview with Melody Maker, Peter Bardens related the importance of
these venues to Camel, "I think the college circuit plays a very
important part in any new band's future.  They are one of those rare
places where small bands get the chance to play, and what's more, they
are always good payers."<P>
One early concert appearance that provided Camel with underground
credibility was on October 8, 1973 at the Greasy Truckers' Party at
Dingwall's Dance Hall in London. A live cut from that show, "God of Light
Revisited Parts 1, 2, and 3" formed one side of a rare double album
commemorating the event, which also featured contributions by progressive
contemporaries Gong and Henry Cow.<P>
As a result of constant touring, the band's second album Mirage
sold much better than its self-titled debut.  Bardens told Melody Maker,
"We started the band from scratch.  We had no money and no equipment.  In
three years we've done four tours of Britain, and we're the sort of band
that creeps up on you."<P>

Camel's first drink of success was its 1975 album The Snow Goose,
an all-instrumental work based on Paul Gallico's children's book.  The
album reached both British and American charts.  Latimer commented to
Melody Maker about the writing of the album, "When we'd written the piece
we were really pleased, then again, it wasn't until we'd finished the
album that we realized what we'd got."  Andy Ward continued, "Snow 
Goose has opened up a reaction in the audience and the press that
we'd been waiting for for a long time."  The band was voted Melody
Maker's Brightest Hope in that magazine's 1975 poll, and performed at The
Royal Albert Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra.<P>
Moonmadness, released in 1976, featured several songs inspired by
the personalities of the band members, including "Chord Change" for
Bardens, "Air Born" for Latimer, "Another Night" for Ferguson, and "Lunar
Sea" for Ward.  Toward the end of the recording sessions for that album,
bassist Doug Ferguson left to form the group Head Waiter.  His
replacement, Richard Sinclair, was the bassist and vocalist for veteran
progressive groups Caravan and Hatfield and the North.  On Rain Dances,
Sinclair became the distinctive vocalist Camel had lacked.  Melody Maker
wrote, "[Sinclair's] vocals were a rare treat, totally unaffected by the
Americanisation most rock singers turned to without question, and
delivered with a tone and pitch that would delight a choir master."<P>
In 1978, Peter Bardens left Camel, replaced by two more
ex-Caravan members, Richard's cousin David Sinclair and Jan Schelhaas,
causing Camel to earn the nickname "Caramel" by the music press.  Camel
also added former King Crimson sax and flute player Mel Collins.  Before
recording sessions could be held, however, Richard and David Sinclair
departed.<P>

Camel found itself deserted by the British music press during the
early eighties, as press attention shifted to punk rock.  Despite sellout
tours of Europe, the group's records no longer sold well.  Andrew Latimer
told Melody Maker in 1980, "Sometimes it's frustrating if you do
something you think is a work of art and it gets totally ignored.  I'd be
lying if I said it wasn't frustrating."  Another major setback during
this period the departure of Andy Ward due to the pressures of touring
and the music industry in general, leaving Latimer as the last original
member of the band.<P>
Latimer was pressured by the record company to record more
pop-oriented material on 1982's The Single Factor which featured members
of The Alan Parsons Project.  Peter Bardens makes a guest appearance on
the track "Sasquatch" along with founding Genesis guitarist Anthony
Philips.  Following the release of Stationary Traveller in 1984, inspired
by the social and physical division of Berlin, Camel took a seven-year
hiatus.

Andrew Latimer relocated to California during the early nineties,
and formed Camel Productions to release new and archival Camel material.
Camel's nineties output includes Dust and Dreams, inspired by John
Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.  Harbour of Tears was inspired by
Latimer's search for his family's roots following his father's death.<P>
In addition to a prolific solo career, Pete enjoyed a brief stint
down memory lane with Andy for a nostaligically titled group "Mirage",
performing a few select dates in 1994.  Since leaving Camel, Andy Ward
has been involved with myriad projects, including progressive rockers
Marillion, Richard Sinclair's Caravan of Dreams and Sinclair's album
R.S.V.P.  One of Ward's most interesting and exciting recent appearances
was at the independent English magazine Ptolemaic Terrascope's Terrastock
Festival in April of 1997, drumming in an impromptu lineup of British
rock's legendary rabble-rousers The Deviants, in addition to a set with
his current band, English psychedelic rockers The Bevis Frond.<P>
Throughout its twenty-five year existence, Camel has scaled the
heights of fame as well as the depths of mainstream media derision,
acquiring a dedicated following along the way.  Through Andrew Latimer's
company, Camel Productions, Camel remains alive and well.
