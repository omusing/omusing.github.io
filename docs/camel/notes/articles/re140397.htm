Santa Ana- For 20 years now, progressive rock has been about as valuable to
pop's store of creative energy as a tapped-out uranium mine.<p>
    Sure, there was some high-grade ore shipped from England during the 
heyday of the late 60's and early 70's, when Yes, Genesis, Gentle Giant,
E.L.P., E.L.O. and King Crimson were working a temporary rich vein in which
rock's drive merged with classical music's grand scale and virtuosity.<p>
    But by 1976 or so, the fun was over; prog-rockers were like bloated
Roman Sybarites, easy pickings for the young, barbarian hordes of punk
and the hearty yeomen of the Springsteen/Petty tribe of heartland rockers.<p>
    What a surprise then that it was not a drag at all to spend more than
2 1/2 hours at the Galaxy Concert Theatre on Wednesday night with Camel.<p>
    Even in its prime, circa 1973-'76, Camel (which also plays tonight at
the Coach House) was a second-echelon member of the British prog-rock
guild, able to place no album higher than No. 118 on the U.S. charts.<p>
    Guitarist Andrew Latimer, the sole remaining original member,
emigrated to Mountain View in Northern California in the late 80's. Over
the past five years there, he has tried to rekindle Camel, which had
pretty much landed in the ashtray by the mid-80's.(The most prominent
Camel alumnus, keyboard player and sometime Van Morrison associate Pete
Bardens, also lives in California and has pursued a solo career of New 
Age-type music; he plays May 1 at the Coach House.)<p>
    The Galaxy Show, played to no more than 150 lustily applauding die-
hards, was Camel's first in the Los Angeles area since 1979, announced
Latimer, a tall, lanky, unpretentious man of few, but pleasant words.
The surprise was not only that the musicians played a good show, but also
that they carried it largely with fine new material.<p>
    The band- Latimer, bassist Colin Bass (he pronounces like the fish,
not the instrument he plays, and has been in Camel since the late '70's)
and new allies Foss Patterson on keyboards and Dave Stewart on drums- 
opened with a spotty hour of '70's-vintage stuff, with moments of lovely
lyricism ("Spirit of the Water") and jazz-fusiony buoyancy ("Sasquatch")
providing the highlights, while attempts at grandiose hymns ("Drafted") 
and slide-guitar brashness fell flat.<p>
    Camel's long second set focused on Latimer's '90's comeback material,
which he has put out on a custom label, Camel Productions. It began with 
the few good bits from "Dust and Dreams", a dreary concept album (what
else) in which Latimer somehow got it in his head that the way to
illustrate the plight of the Dust Bowl Okies of "Grapes of Wrath" was
with stately, high-church layers of synthesizer music. Then Latimer and
company swung into their new concept album, "Harbour of Tears", and 
played it in (what else) its entirety.<p>
    It was entirely a treat. The album, spurred by Latimer's discovery
of Irish roots in his family, focuses on the sadness of the forced mass
migration of the Irish in the face of famine during the mid-19th century,
and their struggles and hopes in America.<p>
    You can quibble that Latimer should have introduced the piece with
some personal comments on why the subject matters to him, instead of
leaving it to Bass to give some rudimentary historical scene-setting. And
Irish eyes will probably roll at the album's utter avoidance of the
political circumstances- callous colonial oppression by bigoted British
overlords- that made the famine so devastating. Overall, though, "Harbour
of Tears" is an unexpected, good, new chapter in prog-rock's history.<p>
    Grounded in folk-based melodies, alternating between sad lyricism in
the exile scenes and bustling tension in the New World segments, the
piece had plenty of emotional ballast to sustain its 50 minutes. The 
execution was beautiful, with Bass and Latimer combining their just-
seviceable voices into something better than  their sum, and superb
musicianship all around.<p>
    Latimer- one of the few prog-rock band leaders to perform in jeans
and T-shirt rather than something befitting a Druid priest or medieval
inhabitant of Sherwood Forest- is as underrated a guitar player as you'll
encounter- a master of clarity, precision and tonal variety, all held
together by close attention to melody and riff and a comendable
resistance to those prog-rock maladies, empty flash and pompous noodling.
Maybe he overdid the rich, vibrato note bending that's a big part of his
arsenal, but often he used it to fine effect.<p>
    The band's encores were just the kind of scrumptious desserts that
encores should be, with choice nuggets from Camel's first two albums- 
the long, undulating "Lady Fantasy", and the hard-charging "Never Let
Go". On these, and in the concluding passages of "Harbour of Tears",
Latimer showed the blues conciousness that gave Camel a kinship to such
'70's comtemporaries as Santana, Jefferson Airplane, and the trippy side
of early Fleetwood Mac.<p>
    You could almost imagine Camel's elegant puffs of lyricism and its 
smoking surges playing nicely nowadays on the H.O.R.D.E. tour's jam-
band caravan. They would, of course, have to come with a cautionary note-
"Warning: Listening may be hazardous to your otherwise healthy disdain
for progressive rock."<p>
