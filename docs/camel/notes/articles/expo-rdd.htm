<H1>Camel `97 - A Conversation with Andy Latimer</H1>

<CITE>Interview by Jeff Melton</CITE></P>
<HR>

The following interview with Andy Latimer, lead guitarist with 
Camel was conducted on Exposure Radio, KSJS, on March 2, 
1997.  Camel was in the San Francisco area preparing to play three 
local shows. Andy took a short break between tight rehearsals to 
phone in from home while Jeff Melton conducted the interview 
from the San Jose State campus. Special thanks to John Szpara for 
providing the forum, and to Carol Hammett for her diligent work 
on the transcription</P>
<B>Exposé:</B> <I> Thanks for taking a break from rehearsals to 
talk to us.</I></P>
<B>Latimer: </B>Oh, that's all right, it's a pleasure.</P>
<I>Why don't you give us a little bit of a background about what's 
going on (with the band)? Where's Camel been since the 1992 
tour?</I></P>
Since 1992? Oh, all sorts of things have been happening. We've 
done two bootleg albums, and one studio album,  in which you've 
just heard one track from, Harbour of Tears. My father passed 
away, so that's taken some adjusting and some time out for myself. 
We were going to do a tour last year that was postponed..</P>
<I>Several of us do get the Camel newsletter, which comes out on 
a semi-regular basis. But, specifically why didn't you tour last 
year? Was it a personnel problem?</I></P>
Yeah. Our keyboard player, Mickey Simmonds, left without telling 
us. Sort of being we didn't find out until too late that he wasn't 
going to do the tour and that basically lead to postponing it because 
we couldn't arrange a replacement in time.</P>
<I>How long did it take for you to recover and try to set up your 
current line-up? As a matter-of-fact, your current-line up is pretty 
much unknown to me and several of the listeners out there. Could 
you give us a break-down about who you've got in the band 
now?</I></P>
Oh, yeah, well we've got Colin Bass still, who plays bass. He's 
been with us for probably 18-19 years and we have a new young 
drummer, Dave Stewart, formerly with Fish. We have a guest 
keyboard player, Foss Patterson who also has played with Fish, 
John Martin and various other people. Both are Scottish lads and 
very good and highly amusing! (laughs)</P>
<I>So the band chemistry is going pretty well with this new line-
up, I suppose?</I></P>
Oh, absolutely. It's an on-going thing. It's one of those things that 
changes at times but the direction of the band is still staying quite 
true to it's former self.</P>

<I>Trying to get the pieces of Camel together has obviously been 
some work for you. I know from talking to Susan Hoover that 
you've been in some pretty tight rehearsals up until the current time 
trying to get ready.</I></P> 
Yeah, it's hell week at the moment...</P>
<I>Are you willing to talk about the current set list?  How are you 
are trying to determine what you're going to play? Or would you 
like to keep that a secret?</I></P>
Well, I could tell you a little bit.  We'll be doing most of Harbour, 
in fact, I think we'll be doing all of Harbour.</P>
<I>That seems to be traditional with the Camel from the past. 
Whenever you have a new album, it's time to come out and play 
the whole thing in it's entirety</I></P>
Well, that is usually the policy.  You try to publicize your latest 
recording; that seems the most sensible thing. Then, you have the 
mammoth task to try to decide what you're going to do from your 
older material. We have quite a few albums to choose from and it's 
always really difficult. It's like, "Do we do this?" and whatever you 
choose, there is always someone who comes up and says, "Well, 
you didn't play this, now did you? It's my favorite!" So, it's always 
very difficult. I think this time around we are doing a bigger chunk 
of The Snow Goose.</P>
<I>Great!</I></P>
We're also doing a bigger chunk of Nude and then we're going to 
do a couple of older things, such as Lunar Sea and a few other 
older items. It's a kind of two-set program.</P>
<I>I just wanted to mention something about that the last live 
album, Never Let Go, which was a chronicle of the last tour. I 
think the set list was put together very well and spotlighted several 
tracks that hadn't been played in quite a long time, such as 
Earthrise.  It also spotlighted what I would call the classic Camel 
tracks, like "Ice", which I think really shows the last line-up very 
well, particularly because that piece builds up to a very strong 
theme towards the end and has a really nice build down.</I></P>
Yeah, it was a successful tour from that point of view, you know. 
We did this sort of chronological thing where we chose quite a few 
different tracks.  It was tricky and we did sort of jiggle around a 
few pieces, but we didn't include anything from Stationary 
Traveler, I think, last time around. It was a very successful tour, 
and we hadn't been out for some seven years or so.</P>
<I>How would you compare the current line-up to the last live 
touring incarnation as far as chemistry?</I></P>
It's very similar.  The chemistry is a lot stronger; I mean, it's so 
much fun to work with everybody. They all have their own 
identities and it's a wonderful line up, you know.  They're so much 
fun and it's interesting working with new people all the time and 
regarding the young drummer we've got: he's excellent. He's got 
loads of energy and he's a great player.</P>
<I>How does he compare to say, like, Andy Ward?</I></P>
Well, he's very similar in a way. He's going to be a monster player 
when he gets older (laughs), I mean, he's a monster player now; 
he's very good. It's very encouraging because he can play all of 
Andy's parts  easily, so it's just fun. I love it.</P>
<I>It does keep it really fresh, which I could definitely tell from 
the last tour, that the band chemistry was really very high.</I></P>
Well I think that changed considerably when Mickey came in 
because Mickey was the one who actually kind of convinced us to 
do it as a four piece. I think that in turn was very instrumental in 
actually getting the spirit back of the original Camel. We were 
always a four-piece, and then we digressed a bit and went up to six 
or seven piece at one stage, so getting back to being a four-piece 
was extremely rewarding and challenging as well, especially this 
time around. I mean, we're doing Harbor of Tears, which is very 
heavily orchestrated, so to create a ninety piece orchestra with four 
people was kind of difficult, you know (laughs). It's a lot of brain 
work and very challenging.</P>

<I>Was Harbor of Tears conceived primarily as a band project or 
was it an intimate, personal statement from you about your family 
history?</I></P>
Well, interesting question. I think that nearly everything I write is a 
personal statement. It's kind of a personal album mainly because of 
the passing of my father. He, in turn, kind of led me to this place in 
Ireland; I discovered after he died that I really didn't know much 
about his background and his family.  He never talked too much 
about it and after he died I thought, "Well, I'll do some 
investigation." I went to see his brother in the North of England 
and he told me quite a bit about some family history, that their 
mother was Irish and I never knew. I then found out that a lot of 
her family left from a place in Ireland called Queenstown, which 
was called Cove Harbor at the time. I started to do some research 
on it, 'cause I didn't know too much about where they all went to, 
the family.  They all sort of emigrated; some went to America, 
some of them went to Canada, Australia and all this and nobody 
knows where or what happened to them.  The story sort of stopped 
there. As I read about the Harbor, I discovered that this place was 
dubbed, "The Harbour of Tears" by a lot of people because it was 
the last sight of Ireland, their homeland, that they saw. A lot of 
families were broken up. The whole thing started to interest me and 
I started to do a lot of research and I found out that the Lusitannia 
was sunk just outside the harbor.</P>
<I>How interesting!</I></P>
And the more stories I read about the more I was drawn into this 
place called Cove Harbor, "The Harbour of Tears". So my father 
kind of led me to this place. A lot of the feelings I got from my 
father, I suppose, came out musically and so there is a strong, 
personal side to it.  It's an incredible place.  The album is about 
different stories that involve different people going through that 
harbor. I always wanted to do a Celtic album. It really all fell into 
place for me.</P>
<I>So, trying to make an album like Harbour of Tears into a live 
state seems to me the same kind of challenge as taking Dust and 
Dreams from the studio to live.</I></P>
Hmmm..., yeah, it is a challenge, I must say, and Foss, our 
keyboard player, is rising to the challenge. It's very difficult to 
create these huge, orchestral things that I've written as a four piece, 
you know. We don't use any sequencers, we don't use any backing 
tracks or anything like that. We just use the four of us and it's a 
challenge, so whether we call it...</P>
<I>What you see is what you get?</I></P>
Yeah. Whether we pull it off or not remains to be seen! 
(laughs)</P>
<I>Oh, I don't know. I'd be very surprised if you couldn't pull it 
off.</I></P> 
(laughs) Oh, we try our best, you know. It's all we can do.  It has 
been fun but it has been a lot of work.</P>
<I>I'm also interested in trying to understand how difficult it was 
to be able to try set up some gigs in the local (San Francisco) Bay 
Area. Does anyone actually remember Camel from the last time 
they played here in town ..?</I></P>
Who knows! (laughter)</P>
<I>It's a challenge! Progressive rock, in general, is looked at as 
something that people don't want to attend on a regular 
basis.</I></P>
Progressive rock is a kind of strange  term, in a way. It's a sort of 
music that is not instantaneous and therefore doesn't get any 
exposure, usually that one would get on radio and TV.  I think you 
have to put a little bit of yourself into it to get something out.  As 
far as getting gigs in this country, it's been kind of difficult, 
compared to places like Japan and Europe where the rest of the 
tour has been very easy to set up. We're very popular everywhere 
else, so America is kind of difficult. You do sort of find that the 
agents phone up and say, "Are you interested in booking Camel?" 
and they say "Who???"  (laughs), so a lot of that goes on. The 
concerts always do very well because the fans are extremely loyal 
and nice people.  They tend to come and make the whole evening a 
nice event.</P>
<I>It seems like the tour is biased toward the bay area and the US 
west coast again. The east coast doesn't have any tour 
dates.</I></P>
We rehearse here and so we're all here and it makes sense to do a 
few shows in California and we're doing a few more than we did 
last time.  We only did about three dates before we went to Japan 
last time and now we're doing a few more in Los Angeles as well 
before we trundle off to Japan. It's nice to play in this area because 
I'm from this area at the moment. It's nice to play here and have 
your friends come.</P>
<I>The people down in Southern California are quite 
happy.</I></P>
Yeah, because I can see a lot of my friends come, it's fun.</P>
<I>Do you have any plans for a rarities box set?</I></P>
A rarities box set? Not really. I mean, we don't really have that 
many rarities. We do have several more tapes and things that I may 
release.</P>
 <I>Well, I do have a few personal tapes which I think would be 
great to find a way to get them released.</I>
Well, yeah, we tend to try and release the bootleg what we call our 
official bootleg albums, just to combat the other bootleggers. We 
found they're releasing poor quality tapes for high prices and we 
thought that was terribly unfair for the fans. So we try to release 
good quality tapes that are reasonably priced and its been fairly 
successful. In the future we'll probably release more, but there's 
not a lot of what I'd call archive stuff. There's a few things I've got 
up my sleeve still but not a lot.</P>
<I>I think there's a few tracks I've heard on some of the tapes I 
have that would be great to hear.</I></P>
Oh, you've probably got more than I have. People send me tapes 
all the time.  I have ones from Germany, from Offenbach , you 
know, I've never heard before. Where these people get these tapes, 
I have no idea.</P>
<I>Just well connected.</I></P>
Yeah, maybe so, maybe so.</P>
<I>Camel productions is a home-based business, right? You and 
Susan pretty much do everything? Is that how it works?</I></P>
No, absolutely not, we can't do everything (laughs). We have lots 
of people to help.  We have Neil Paton, Mary Reese, and Bill 
Richardson and, gawd, loads...Sarah, Roger and there's Paris, 
Laurie and Harriet Stroud. I mean, there's loads of people we use 
because there's no way we could do it all ourselves. I mean, the 
business is just overwhelming. Susan basically does most of the 
business stuff and I try to do most of the creative stuff and we have 
lots of people to help us. We just couldn't function, otherwise.</P>
<I>How difficult is it to maintain a presence in the music business 
with a band like Camel?</I></P>
Maybe, not so much.  A lot of things have happened to me in my 
life that have put things back, if you like.  My father died and I had 
to go to England.  That took quite a considerable amount of time 
away from creating and I'm a slow writer anyway - I tend to take 
my time about what I do and fuss over things until I get them how I 
like and so maybe I'm not as productive as I should be.  As I get 
older, I want to sort of change that and be more productive.</P>
<I>It may take longer, but I'd say it's been worth the 
wait.</I></P>
Hmm, well, thanks, you know, we try  and that's as much as you 
can do. And, in turn, it takes time. Like Dust and Dreams, I 
finished writing it and then I wasn't happy with it and then I tried 
to get a deal with it in England. Nobody was really that interested 
so then I decided the only way I could do it was to set up my own 
company. I had to sell my house and I moved to America because 
it was more economical to do the album here.  I invested all my 
money into it; it was a bit of a gamble, but it worked. People 
started buying the record and we were on the right road and it was 
a fabulous decision, in a way.  At the time, it was a decision I was 
sort of forced into but upon reflection, it was a fabulous thing that 
happened to me because it made me responsible for my own career. 
I couldn't blame the record company every time I had a flop;  it 
was me who was responsible now and it became a very personal 
thing.  I receive letters from the fans now and I never did when I 
was with Decca, so now I have direct contact with people who buy 
our albums and I love it. I love the fact that I go out on the road 
now and I can go to Japan and I can meet people that are in our fan 
base and I can speak to them on a first name basis. It's lovely and a 
rewarding experience.  They write to me and tell me what they 
think of what I'm doing; sometimes it's very positive and 
sometimes it's not so flattering. (Overall) I think it's fabulous.  I 
don't have to worry about the pressures that the record industry 
brings to their artists. They all try to change you and make it easy 
for them to make a million. I've never been somebody who writes 
a hit single, so it's nice for me to go into a studio and write 
something from my heart and not worry whether it's commercial or 
not.</P>
<I>Are you going to be writing new material during the course of 
touring? I don't know how much time you have for it but, what 
kind of plans do you have in this area?</I></P>
I probably won't be writing anything while I'm on tour. I usually 
try and absorb as much of the tour as I can do; certainly the new 
places that I'm going to this time. I'm going to Poland; I haven't 
been there before, and Slavakia, so I'll be absorbing a lot of that.  
Who knows, I may use some of that when I write the next project.  
But as soon as I come back, I'll start writing some more material 
for another project because I do want to do a live-type album for 
the next album and may turn out some orchestrations but a much 
more simpler thing.</P>
<I>With a real band in the studio?</I></P>
Yes! A real band with real people! (laughs)....</P>
<I>Well, I mean, the last two albums, they're good. They are 
definitely a product of the studio and the people you are 
assembling at the time you are able to put it together.</I></P>
Like I was mentioning before...</P>
<I>Done on more of an individual basis, you mean?</I></P>
Yeah, a lot of the better Camel albums are definitely a result of the 
band chemistry of the people that were there, all at the same time, 
in a studio, all playing together. And there is really great synergy 
that seems to happen, whether it's the Nude lineup or definitely the 
older period albums up through  Moonmadness which are very 
much characterized in this way. It seems that's how that was 
working for a long time and just the possibility of having a group 
of people all together at the same time playing your stuff creates a 
lot of energy and people can get a good reaction to it real fast.</P>
<I>What is it that distinguished Camel from other 1970's 
progressive bands, do you think?</I></P>
Good question! (laughs)  The name! (laughs). I don't really know 
actually, Jeff. That's a kind of hard question. I don't really know 
what distinguishes us from other progressive bands.</P>
<I>You do have a definite identity, if nothing else, based on your 
solo lead guitar work, which is the consistent thread through all the 
projects.</I></P>
Yes. I don't really know that much about the progressive scene, as 
such. I go into record stores;  (for instance), I was in CD 
Warehouse down in Sunnyvale-which is a wonderful place-I love 
all the people in there-it's a great place and they've got this huge 
progressive section in there and I look at them and think, "I don't 
know  any of these bands!"(laughs) So, it's very difficult for me to 
make a comment on the progressive scene, if you like.</P>
<I>Well, it seems to me that the identifiable trait of what makes it 
Camel is the song writing and I'd say, more often than not, 
virtuoso players.</I></P>
Well, the band, yes, has always had some interesting players, very 
good players They've interpreted the music in whatever way and 
some have been successful and others not. They've had their input 
and it's been very good at times.</P>
<I>And you've managed to keep the link going with quality level 
still high. I also think the identity of who and what is Camel is still 
going forward without the sort of "splinter" thing that happens 
when people leave the band.</I></P>
Well, I think we re-found ourselves in the 90's in a way, if that 
makes sense. We did rediscover the spirit of Camel and I think 
because the spirit of Camel...after Doug Ferguson left, which was 
nearly 20 years ago now, (he was the original bass player)  the 
spirit went...as soon as Richard Sinclair came into the band, it sort 
of departed. All of our roles in the band sort of changed as soon as 
Doug left and it was more of an "individuals" kind of band, 
although we still tried to retain some sort of direction as far as the 
music was concerned.  But it wasn't always easy because people 
pulled you one way and then another, you know. In the 90's, we 
sort of rediscovered the spirit of Camel, what Camel is all about. 
Also, I think Susan is very instrumental in pulling the band in a 
good direction, too. She was always a very strong force as far as 
Camel is concerned. She is really the one who kept us going, in a 
way.</P>
<I>Interesting...so, why is it that you still like doing Camel 
because I hear some rumors that people say you are a very good 
blues player..</I></P>
(laughing)...yeah, well, I'd like to do that too, actually, Jeff.  The 
thing is about Camel is that I've always loved the direction of the 
band in a way sometimes it gets lost but most of the time it's a kind 
of spirit and direction but I can't really put my finger on it.  I'm not 
very clear about it, I don't really know why, what it is I like about 
Camel. I don`t know. It's fun  still, which is my main criteria for 
going forward. When it ceases to be fun then I don't think I'll do it 
any more.  It's always been a fun thing. It's nice to be able to be 
creative without restrictions from the record industry.</P>

<img src="andy2.jpg">
</CENTER><BR>
<I>Great! From a strictly artistic standpoint, what is your opinion 
of the material on the Camel tribute CD, that was released on 
Mellow records in Italy?</I></P>
I actually just bought  that, Jeff. I didn't know about it.  Somebody 
told me about it and said, "There's going to be a tribute", and I 
thought, "Oh?!" (laughs). One side of me says, "Wow". You're 
very flattered that any of these people would want to go in and 
record some of your material. It's very  flattering and I'm, you 
know, delighted  with a lot of them.  It's very interesting.  On the 
other hand, it's a kind of strange tribute where the record company 
who's doing the album, doesn't actually tell  the person that they're 
giving the tribute to, you know what I mean?  They probably didn't 
pay any of the bands that did it and they're certainly not paying us 
anything, so you know, it's kind of an interesting thing that this 
whole thing came about.  But the album itself is, uh, entertaining.  
Some of it is very good and some of it is, uh, is..(laughs)..</P>
<I>Not quite you'd expect?</I></P>
No, but it's interesting to hear other people play your music.  Some 
Italian bands, some of them are very interesting, you know. I can't 
say I'd approach some of things as they do. There's a track called, 
"Tell me", that Peter and I did and from how it's done on the 
tribute album, it could be a single, it sounded very commercial. It's 
sung in an Italian voice and it's just a different way of looking at 
your material. Still, I'm very flattered that they've done it.</P>
<I>Was Camel invited to have a track on the Supernatural 
Fairytales box set? There seems to be some question about why 
Camel's not represented in the context of all the other progressive 
bands on that set.  Are you familiar with the box set?</I></P>
No.</P>
<I>It came out, I believe, on Rhino Records. They're doing a lot of 
the re-issue stuff and they're gobbling up some progressive rock 
icons, such as ELP, from the 70's. They re-released their whole 
catalog, don't know if that was absolutely necessary to do, but they 
put together a pretty good box set. It has an interesting overview of 
a lot  of different kinds of  70's bands, ranging all the way from 
Yes, then getting into a lot of other bands, like Quiet Sun and a lot 
of the more obscure Italian bands. So, it seems to me that Camel 
would have been a very logical choice to have included in this 
overall packaging.</I></P>
Yes, especially since they've got two of our Janus albums.</P>
<I>Oh really?</I></P>
I didn't even know about it until they obviously thought better of 
putting us on there! (laughs)  It's something I didn't know about 
and it was obviously one of their executive decisions.  Maybe we'll 
be on the next one.</P>
<I>If there is  a next one! (laughs)</I></P>
..yeah! (laughs hard)  If this one doesn't do too well, then probably 
no.</P>
<I>What would you say some of your favorite Camel songs are 
and why? </I></P>
Hmmmm, well there are all sorts of tracks. That's a difficult 
question because I do like things like Ice, and I like that because it 
was a live thing and it was actually the only live track that we did 
on that album.</P>
<I>It is my personal favorite (laughs)... </I></P>
Oh, that's funny.  It is the only thing that we did live; the rest was 
done sort of individually.</P>
<I>It's a very powerful piece. It's a slow building piece. And the 
resolution at the end is quite good. You feel like you've been 
through a major ordeal.. </I></P>
(laughs hard) We did ! But there are some faves.  I like bits of The 
Goose. I like Nude quite a bit still. It was quite a nice album for 
me.  Of course, I like the ones since we've gone independent. I 
enjoy listening to Dust and Dreams and Harbour, which is quite 
different for me. I don't usually listen to much to my material. I 
don't listen to much of the older stuff.  But on the tracks that I like 
sort of things like Elke I think that was kind of a successful track 
that we did with Brian Eno.</P>
<I>A very  pretty piece. </I></P>
It was a nice experience to work with Brian Eno. He was an 
extremely nicer person, great fun to work with.  But there are 
several tracks that I like on the first album for strange reasons, I 
suppose.</P>
<I>You know, it's actually really good. The first album is 
something that is pretty elusive; a lot of people never really heard 
of the band... </I></P>
.No. We were only signed to MCA and then we got dropped from 
MCA after that first album, well they dropped a lot of artists at that 
time but it was a great experience and it was a great time for the 
band. When we just started out.  It was a very exciting time.  We 
were all young and very enthusiastic bags of energy and worked 
well together as a four piece. It was a very magical time for us, but 
things like Lady Fantasy, we still play it. It's a sort of golden oldie. 
In certain periods of each album, there is a certain naivet‚ about 
pieces that I like, that are fun. They bring a smile to me when Andy 
was, you know, blowing in a bucket of water, bits of lunacy....</P>
<I>That's really funny (laughs)... </I></P>
Just nice periods, because Andy was always into that sort of thing; 
I mean, on one track or two he decided he'd use hair spray or 
deodorant spray, and to use it's sound. By the end of the session, 
the actual studio stunk to high heaven. (laughter). But you listen to 
a track and you conjure up these images and it brings a smile to 
your face.</P>
<I>One of the first tours that you did on the west coast, was that 
supporting Wishbone Ash? </I></P>
Yeah, absolutely..</P>
<I>You went all the way up and down the west coast, is that 
correct? </I></P>
Well, we went all over America. I mean, it was unbelievable tour 
for us. We started out thinking it was going to be a month's tour, 
but the manager came to us in New York and said, "How do you 
fancy spending Christmas here?" We said "Where?" and they said, 
"Florida" and we said, "well, all right." and we did and it went on 
for three months, this tour. We supported Wishbone Ash  and we 
supported Kiss and Steppenwolf. It was funny because when we 
came over to America thinking, "We'll show the Americans some 
English-type material" and we started playing all this stuff and the 
second gig in, somebody shouted out, "ROCK AND ROLL!!", you 
know, started jeering at us, so we thought, "We better play all our 
fast stuff". We only did a half hour or 45 minutes and we were 
doing all these fast numbers. It was kind of funny! (laughs)</P>
<I>Is this the Mirage period? </I></P>
Actually, it probably was from the Mirage period.  It was..well, 
maybe it was later than that, Jeff. I'm sorry my memory is sort of a 
bit hazy.  I'm a bit rehearsed-out, I think!  It was an enjoyable tour 
because it was our first experience in going to America and we 
were playing to large audiences, but I don't know how much good 
it did the band because we didn't really have time to play anything 
of substance. We were playing all this rock and roll.</P>
<I>Yes actually benefited from odd billings, too, opening for 
Black Sabbath around the time that Fragile was released. I can tell 
you that there is probably the same association with Camel.  People 
come and see some band they don't even know and they walk 
away with that in their heads for awhile.. </I></P>
Yes, possibly so. It was a very interesting experience and my first 
experience in America and I kind of really enjoyed it. It was a very 
nice experience.</P>
