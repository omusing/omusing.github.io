<center><H2>Interview with Andrew Latimer<BR>about "Harbour Of Tears", March 1996</H2></center>

<I><B>Q:</B> It is something new for Camel fans to hear melodies with a definitive
"Celtic" character on a Camel album. Is it also something new for you ?
Would this mean that Camel's music, until now, reflected only a part of
your own musical "personality" ?</I>
<P>
<B>Andrew:</B> As far as the Celtic side of the character, yes it is new, but all Camel
albums have a flavour of whatever it requires. It's whatever the story
demands, and I hope every album explores a new part of my personality. I
hope I haven't discovered all of my personality yet. For me it's not a
conscious thing to do any style of music. It's just however the feeling
takes me at the time.
<P>
<I><B>Q:</B> Reading the concept of the album for the first time made me expect a very
nostalgic and sad album, some kind of "Dust & Dreams, Part 2". I was
surprised to find much more optimism and positive energy, as though your
Irish ancestors leaving their native land was not only filled with
desperation, but also with high expectations and hope for a new, wealthier
life. Is this what you wanted to express ?</I>
<P>
<B>Andrew:</B> Yes, partly. I partly wanted to portray the excitement of a new life. But
also to portray the sadness of leaving the family and the sadness of how a
father and son cannot communicate their true feelings to one another. The
procedure of making music is from the heart, not from the head, so my
feelings for each piece are both kind of personal and I find it difficult
to explain. I actually don't want to tell people what I was thinking. I
like them to take whatever they get out of it.
<P>
<I><B>Q:</B> There is, in my opinion, a strong sense of release towards the end of both
"Dust & Dreams" and "Harbour Of Tears", as if you could only really "take
off", full steam ahead, once you're done with the vocal, concept-related
stuff. This is not to criticize the vocals, especially on the nw album, yet
I find the climax is really in the second, mainly instrumental, half... </i>
<P>
<B>Andrew:</B> I think the simple answer to this is that I like to set a musical stage. To
do that, there has to be a beginning and an end. Hopefully, the climax is
at the end and you'll want to start again, from the beginning, not the
middle or end.
