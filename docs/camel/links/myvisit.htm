<center><h2>Ofir Zwebner's Camel Experience</h2></center>
On Wednesday, April 9th 1997, I left my home on a flight to London, to see a Live Camel.<p>

<p>
Well, not just <i>any</i> Camel...<br><p>
While the echoes of my first ever Camel gig still ringing in my ears, I've been expecting to finally meet
the boys in the band, but, most specifically, a Lady.

Above, you can see (from left to right) Mrs Susan Hoover, myself, and Mr. Dave Stewart, a wonderful drummer and definably a scotsman. As you can see, we've all got Teeth. Many, many, many teeth.

After waiting a rather long time for all the other fans to buzz off (in the meanwhile I've had a nice chat 
with Susan Hoover, who's charms in person fit her kindness and warmness over our 7 years old correspondence), I have approached Andy and presented
myself. It seems we were both very happy to finally see eachother. I know I was.

Although Dave was actually anxious to get to the dressing room, he very happy to join a photo with
Andy and me. As you can see, I'm curling back my lips again.

Last picture taken before saying goodbye and not seeing again for another ten years :-(
<br> Susan has 
rushed in to fit in the frame. she's actually taller, btw :-)<br> I'm standing on my toes to try to fit 
Andy's height - no chance! These people were very warm and funny, and the good spirit caused me to surface
yet another silly impression on my rubber face. <b>Important:</b> Notice the <b>Kermit the Frog</b> 
T-Shirt I'm wearing. I think this is going to be my personal trademark. Fortunately, Kermit was able to make
it to the picture just as well.
<p>
The pictures were shot by Peter Thomas, a devoted Camel fan - thanks!
