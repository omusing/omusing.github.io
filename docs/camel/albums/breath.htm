<p>
The most arguable <B>Camel</B> album. Some fans rank it number one, yet some can't stand it. 
Given the previous album's feeling of "songs for rainy days", this is <B>Camel</B>'s first album since 1974 without a real concept.
Although many songs are short and poppy, there are some typically complex and jazzy
tracks, (<i>Echoes</i>, <i>The sleeper</i>). Sinclair's influence is more evident here, in a 'spiritual' manner - his vocals, his tongue-in-cheek lyrics and his bass work are all prominent.<br>
The album's inner sleeve has pictures of the members (Collins included). <br>
Beware of One Way Records release which is poorly
designed, and has no sleeve notes like the Deram one, although the sound
quality is OK. The Deram CD cover has been retouched, the Camel logo and the Breathless title lacking the 'smokiness' featured in the original LP. 
The Israeli LP release has a different song order printed
on the cover, though the record is the same.<p>

<B><font color="FF0000">Consumers Alert:</font></b> A problem has been reported on the Deram CD release of <i>Breathless</i>, as described by Dave of Studio Seventeen:<br>
<ul>
From: Studio Seventeen<br>
Date: Sat, 17 Nov 1996<br>
The problem occurs during track 6, "Summer Lightning". from 2:47 through to
about 3:00 (one of the nicest parts of the song BTW) the speed of the master tape
audibly SLOWS in a most horrifying way. First slightly, from 2:47 to about 2:52,
and then a REALLY sickening lurch at moment 2:54. It starts to sound "normal"
again after minute 3:00, but the pitch variations (for my ears anyway) destroy the
musical integrity of the track.<br>
Other than that, the disc seems OK. <p>
</ul>
This error has been reported to happen on the Deram 820-726-2 (UK, printed in Germany). It's been reported that 
the One Way Records and the Deram Japanese version are fine. Jim Preston reported that his copy of the same 
Deram release does not carry this defect. I've personally checked the Deram 820-726-2, made in Germany, which didn't have this defect. The One Way Records was ok too.
