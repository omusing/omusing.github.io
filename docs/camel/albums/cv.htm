<b><i>Curriculum Vitae</i></b> presents the story of <b>Camel</b> from its early days of its predecessor <b>Brew</b>, through the climactic success of <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b>, the lineups changes that followed Doug Ferguson's departure, and the revival in the 90's. The program was originally created for British Channel 4 TV series "Top Ten", to which Andrew Latimer, Andy Ward and Peter Bardens were interviewed. The program was extended by <b>Camel Productions</b>, by incorporating more interviews and video material. The highlights of the DVD are some rare live video footage from the various incarnations of the band.<br>
<br>
The DVD contains an extra 12 minutes interview with Latimer, Ward and Ferguson, who got together in 2003 and worked out a new non-Camel album, to be released later in 2003 or early 2004.
