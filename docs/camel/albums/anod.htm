Following a successful tour in 2000, Andrew Latimer and Susan Hoover, 
supported by Canadian keyboardist Guy LeBlanc, delivered a set of compositions that 
draw back from the roots of <b>Camel</b>'s music, and reflect on them. The result is an 
often cheerful, light-hearted album, which refers to or quotes from the Prog Rock music 
of the early 70s and the music of <b>Camel</b> itself.
Unlike <b><i>Rajaz</i></b>, in which Latimer's guitar was most prominent, this album is 
laden with a lot of flute and keyboards. While some tracks are obviously amusing and funny, 
the album's final track, the 10 minutes piece <i>For Today</i>, relates to the disaster of 
September 11th and concludes the album with a sensitive and emotional climax.

As stated in the CD sleeve, the song <i>For Today</i> is dedicated to the courageous spirit of the High Diver on September 11th, 2001. The "High Diver" is a reference to person who chose to accept his fate, and dived to his death. The graceful, almost atheletic pose of his body, (<a href="http://www.navexpress.com/911/2.htm">http://www.navexpress.com/911/2.htm</a>) inspired Susan Hoover to refer to him as a High Diver.

Some music and playing styles suggest a reference to other bands or other songs: A guitar riff on <i>Simple Pleasures</i> has references to a vocal part from <i>Rajaz</i> ("The soles of heaven turn to stars..."). The acoustic guitar at the beginning of <i>The Miller's Tale</i> is reminiscent of Anthony Philips guitar work. <i>Fox Hill</i> has a theme which is close to <b>Genesis'</b> <i>Squonk</i>, and is sung with accent and character roles, similar to Peter Gabriel's singing on <b>Genesis'</b> <i>I know what I like</i>, for example.
