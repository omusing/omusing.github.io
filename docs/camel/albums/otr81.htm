<b>Camel Productions</b>' fourth official live bootleg was recorded by the BBC at the 
Hammersmith Odeon, London, England on 2nd April 1981 during the Nude tour. The performance was edited
by the BBC, which is probably the cause for the lack of songs that would have made this a complete live 
rendition of <b><i>Nude</i></b>. Notably in this performance are Kit Watkins flute solos on various 
tracks.<br>
The CD sleeve details, for each musician, his years of activity in Camel. Quite unlike other releases of 
material recorded live, the CD booklet encloses the lyrics to the songs.
