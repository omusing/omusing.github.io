<B>Camel</b>'s third Official Bootleg was
recorded on 13th June 1982, once again in Holland, and was chosen as an exemplary
10th anniversary tour for being a particularly delightful performance for the
band. The CD sleeve details who sang solo in what songs and who played the guitar
solos.<br>
This CD has been recently been <font color="#ff0000"><B>deleted</B></font> by <B>Camel Productions</B>. You can order it before it runs out of stock.

<tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td> Originally recorded by a Dutch radio station, the master had
been destroyed, and this CD was mastered from a tape recorded by the sound
engineer Pete Ward. Latimer consider this source "less then desirable" from a
production standpoint, as "the bass end is not quite up to scratch because it
was recorded directly through the mixing desk."
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td> Three other songs which were performed at that night, <i>Remote
Romance</i>, <i>Rhayader Goes to Town</i> and <i>No Easy Answer</i> were
beyond salvage and do not appear on the CD.
