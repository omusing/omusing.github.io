<B>Camel</b>'s debut album can be considered among their finest. Very
similar in sound textures and production to their second release,
it features some jazz-rock improvisation tracks, along with
simple (yet grooving) rock songs. Peter Bardens' fantastic Organ
improvisations are heavily featured here, although Latimer's guitar solos feel held
back a little <br>
The Record's original back cover has a black & yellow picture of the band<br>
The album was once available on LP by MCA records, and was reissued by
<B>Camel Productions</b> on CD. The CD has a lyrics sheet and pictures of the group. <p>
<b>Note:</b> A remastered edition of <b><i>Camel</i></b> has been released in 2002 by MCA/Universal. This edition contains additional 23 minutes in two bonus tracks: <i>Never Let Go</i> (Single version) and <i>Homage to the God of Light</i> (live at the Marquee Club, 29th October 1974). <a href="comp_camel.htm">Read a comparitive review</a> of the two releases.<br>
