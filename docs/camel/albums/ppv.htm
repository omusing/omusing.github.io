 A video of the show from the <i><B>Pressure Points</i></b> album, which took place at
London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1984. The live video recording is combined with
short, directed "movie" clips, supposedly bounding the whole songs of the
performance to the concept of the <i><B>Stationary Traveller</i></b> album, about
refugees and Travellers. Some may find these movie flicks a bit irritating. In
my copy there were some disturbing sound dropouts, but the sound quality is
generally better then the <i><B>Total Pressure</i></b> video. <p>
