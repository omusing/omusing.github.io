<H4><B>Editor's note:</b> This section is a bit strange, to me too.
Insufficient information leads to what we have here. I've got lot's of
data coming from various people, and the information is almost always
incomplete. This is all I could come up with. 7" or 12" references are obvious,
I believe. I need the exact serial numbers, record company, size (7/12 inch),
and songs list. <br>
John Tracy claims in one of the CD's liner notes that <B>Camel</b>
released only 4 singles. There appear to be more. I asked Andy Latimer but the
response was that he didn't really know what nor how many singles were
released.</H4>

Nick Loebner informs that his copy of the single features a somewhat different take of the song. The single is also backed with a live performance of <i>Lunar Sea</i>, which is different from any other officialy released rendition. Apart for that, this single's sides are strangely recorded at different speeds of 45 rpm and 33 1/3 rpm.
