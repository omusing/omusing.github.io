<B>Camel</b>'s sound stepping into the 80's with the notable production of Rupert Hine and keyboard work by virtuoso Kit Watkins. Some pop songs, some classic orchestration,
some very good instrumentals, some less... But definitely <i>Ice</i> is the peak of this album; voted as the band's most favourite track,
<I>Ice</I> is an emotional, impressive progressive piece, of over 10 minutes long.<br>

Some ideas about the album's name and cover suggest it is based on a rather irreverent
joke (which, if you really want, you can <a href="../humour/injokes.htm">read</a> on the <a href="../humour/humour-fr.htm" target="body">Humour</a> section).
Further dwelling into the subject leads to think that the cover is a reference to the then-recently 
departure of Peter Bardens. The crucified astronaut could be a reference to Peter's penchant for 
spacey sounding keyboards and themes. Taken a bit further, it could be that the cover art and title of 
Peter Bardens' <b><i>Seen One Earth</i></b> (from 1987) is a reply of sorts to the <b><i>I Can See...</b></i> joke. 
Although quite interesting, this is totally incorrect... <b>CP</b> informs the members simply liked the vulgar joke, and wanted to give <B>Camel</B>
a bit funnier aspect than the serious 'musician' status.
<i>(The idea was submitted by Jeff Gebhardt. Jeff, you were wrong, sorry.)</i>

<i>Ice</i> was recorded live in the studio at The Farmyard in Little Chalfont, Berkshire. Latimer wanted to redo the track because of the slightly flat guitar note in the beginning of the solo. The rest of the band, along with producer Rupert Hine and Phil Collins urged him to keep the track as is.
