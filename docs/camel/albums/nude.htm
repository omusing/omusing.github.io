<B>Camel</b> re-forming with several new musicians, delivering an excellent
progressive rock album with great sound and some intense instrumental sections.
Although it is the most 'concept album' since 1975's <I><B>The Snow Goose</B></I>, <i><B>Nude</i></b> 
doesn't sound like the early
band's progressive efforts; the sound equipment and instruments are
different (as well as Bardens' typical organ playing missing), but in it's own
way, Nude gained high praise among fans and serves as a fine bridge toward Camel's 80's and 90's releases.<br>
Unlike some LP releases, the CD feature the story behind the concept of
<i><B>Nude</i></b>. Some LP releases have fold jackets, some have the story and lyrics on
an inner sleeve. <p>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td> The album tells the allegedly true story of a Japanese soldier who
was  marooned on an island during World War II, and stayed there for 29
years, oblivious to the outside world.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td>Susan Hoover provided the concept for the album, and some songs lyrics.
She explains that the inspiration came from a book called "Heroic Failures".
It turned out that the story told in the album was very close to the real
facts. Rumour has it that that soldier wasn't able to live in the
crowded, post-war Japan, and now owns a farm in South America.

Contrary to all the album since <i><b>The Snow Goose</b></i>, the material was written and played before small audiences prior to being recorded. <b>Camel</b> toured Holland under the incognito <b>'Desert Song'</b>, rewrote a few songs and then recorded the album at Abby Road's No. 3 studio.

The track <i>Docks</i>, cowritten by Latimer and Kit Watkins is in some way a rendition of Kit Watkin's <i>Mount St. Helens</i> track, from his first solo album, <i><b>Labyrinth</b></i>. Part of the middle section of the track was absent in the Watkins solo.
