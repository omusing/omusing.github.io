1982 found Camel with no direction but with many talented musicians. The album has it moments, but some people dislike it. Some claim
it resembles Alan Parsons Project. (No wonder: same people on both groups:
Chris Rainbow, David Paton). Many pop songs, and one
interesting instrumental <i>Sasquatch</i>.<br>
The front and back cover (not available on the CD) 
are slightly different, but same idea - a distorted picture of Andrew Latimer's face. 
The LP inner sleeve includes lyrics, and
lots of photos of the band and other people involved, Some LP pressings have no inner notes/lyrics.
<i><B> The Single Factor</i></b> was once released on CD, with a B/W photo on the
booklet instead of blue/white. A new DERAM CD is available by now.<p>

</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td>Note the guest appearance of Peter Bardens
on <i>Sasquatch</i>, a song about Andy Latimer's feet (according to the
<i><B>Total Pressure</i></b> video). There is also a small picture of two feet and
shoes in the inner jacket, entitled "Sasquatch". Susan explains: "Sasquatch is
the American Indian name for Big Foot. Andrew has big feet."
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td> This is the first album without Andy Ward, which leaves us with only Andy
Latimer from the original <B>Camel</b> lineup. A note on the lyrics
sheet claims that "Ward does not appear on this album following a serious
injury to his hand."
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td> The album's title may give us a hint about what <B>Camel</b>
were aiming at the time. Or it may be read as a sign of complaint that
releasing singles is an important factor, and so we've got this album coming
out.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td> In an interview, Andy admitted that at the time of working on the album
the band was at a very critical stage of it's existence, apparently they were
all under great stress, perhaps from the record company. Andrew: "The Single Factor [...] basically came about by accident. That album was a bit
directionless in a way. It suffered considerably as a result of Andy's leaving."

</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/triviap.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td>Fry and Monkman, as well as Herbie Flowers who appeared on <B><i>Nude</i></b> 
were members of <B>Sky</b> during 1981 - 1982. Both <B>Camel
</b> and <B>Sky</b> were produced and engineered by Tony Clark
and Haydn Bendall in those years. This could be the background for their
guest appearances.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/triviap.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td>Anthony Phillips is from the very early incarnation of
<B>Genesis</b>, who later released several progressive-oriented
albums.
