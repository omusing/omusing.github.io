Often voted as <B>Camel</B>'s best album, <B><I>Moonmadness</I></B> is an impressive album. Most of it has a "Spacy"
or "Atmospheric" texture of sound, being totally different from the feeling
of <B>Camel</b>'s earlier albums. It features some impressive instrumental, complex
parts, echoed, reverberating electric guitars (in a <B>Pink
Floyd</b>ian <i>Shine on You Crazy Diamond</i> style, perhaps)
and a significant switch to synthesizers. This is a classic progressive album, though the music
tends, somewhat, to fusion. <br>
Another cover, from the (early ?) US Janus 7024 releases, featured a circular
picture of a the weeping Camel from the first debut album, now in a spacesuit
with a British emblem, standing on a lunar landscape. The inside cover has the
UK cover picture.<br>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> A remastered edition of <b><i>Moomnadness</i></b> has been released in 2002 by Deram/Universal. This edition contains additional 32 minutes in five bonus tracks: <i>Another Night</i> (Single version), <i>Spirit of the Water</i> (demo), <i>Song within a Song</i>, <i>Lunar Sea</i> and <i>Preparation/Dunkirk</i> (live at the Marquee Club, April 14th 1976). <a href="comp_moon.htm">Read a comparitive review</a> of the two releases.<br>

<i>Moonmadness</i> began as a loose concept album based on the personalities of the band members, <i>Another Night</i> - Doug Ferguson, <i>Air Born</i> - Andy Latimer, <i>Chord Change</i> - Peter Bardens, and <i>Lunar Sea</i> - Andy Ward.

In <i>Aristillus</i>, the opening track, Andy Ward's voice on the background is saying "Aristillus Autolycus". 
Susan Hoover explains: <I>'The band thought it sounded like
'Aristillus ought to like us' and so Andy repeated it during the song
because he was the only one who could say it over and over again without
getting tongue-tied.'</I>. Bill Thompson explains: '<I>Aristillus and Autolycus are two
distinctive naked-eye craters (not lunar seas as best I can tell) on the
near-side of the moon in the middle-upper-just-left-of-center area of the
moon.  They are very near the Apollo 15 landing site and are in the lunar
sea named Imbrium.</I>'

 The Vinyl pressing of the album had a continuous sound of growling thunder recorded in the center groove that would play endlessly (well, unless the tone arm was lifted). This effect could not be repeated on the CD pressing...

Ferguson introduced the band to saxophonist Mel Collins, who became a
 part-time player on their live gigs. Mel Collins also worked with King
 Crimson, Eric Clapton, Richard Wright, Dire Straits, Clannad and many more
 bands and artists.
