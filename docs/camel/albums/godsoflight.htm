<B>Camel</b>'s sixth Official Bootleg consists of recordings which were perviously released on various vinyl and CD bootlegs, covering some of the original lineup's best moments.
The first track was originally released on the <B><I>Greasy Trackers</I></B> compilation album. Tracks 2 through 4 are from a 1974 BBC broadcast. The last track is from BBC Radio One in Concert, 1975.
Although somewhat similar in content to other live CDs, such as <B><I>On the Road 1972</I></B> or <B><I>A Live Record</I></B>, this album presents some brilliant performances, including a very 
interesting rendition of <B><I>The Snow Goose</I></B> without Orchestra - just as Latimer and Bardens may have conceived the masterpiece before it went into production and recording.
