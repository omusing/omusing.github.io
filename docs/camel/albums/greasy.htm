<td> Another live performance of <i>Lord of Light</i> is available
on <i><B>Camel on the Road 1972</i></b>, entitled <i>God of Light</i>.
This song was originally featured on Peter Barden's debut album <i><B>The
Answer</i></b>, before <B>Camel</b> was formed. For many years
<B><i>Greasy Truckers</i></b>
album was the only official one to feature the song being played by
<B>Camel</b>, until the release of the <i><B>Camel on the Road
1972</i></b> official bootleg. The song tends to get other titles, such as
<i>God of Light</i>, <i>Homage to the Lord of Light</i>,
<i>God of Light Revisited </i> etc.

<td>It seems like <i><b>Greasy Truckers</i></b> wasn't much "live" at Dingwalls 
Dance Hall; Only the <b>Camel</b> side and the <b>Global Village</b> side are
traditional live recordings. <b>Gong</b> didn't like their set - It's live, but it's studio
doctored ... it appears that the tapes were assembled according to chance, so while 
the side does contain things like "6/8 Tune" and "You Can't Kill Me", they're not 
in their complete forms. Their two constructions on the album were made from 
concerts taped in Tabarka, Tunisia on the date of the Full Moon, June, 1973, and the
date of the Full Moon, October, 1973 at Sheffield City Hall.. The 
<b>Henry Cow</b> side is studio recorded - they were due to go on last, but curfew 
prevented them from going on at all). The concert took place on October
8, 1973 at a real place called Dingwall's Dancehall, located in Camden Lock
in the UK, except for <b>Henry Cow</b>, which took place at the Manor on November
4, 1973. <i>(Thanks, Datboy!)</i>
