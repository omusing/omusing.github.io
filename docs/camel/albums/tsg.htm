<i><B>The Snow Goose</i></b> is perhaps <B>Camel</b>'s most accessible album.
Recommended for <B>Camel</b> newcomers, and for everybody - not
necessarily for Progressive Rock fans. <i><B>The Snow Goose</i></b> is a completely
instrumental concept album, an instrumental piece, gathered together from it's 16
"songs"; some of which featuring an orchestra, two with vocal (but
without lyrics). Once again <B>Camel</b> play complex time meters,
but here the guitar and organ improvisations are held back, in favour of
well-structured solos that fit into the album's concept.<br>
The Janus release of <i><B>The Snow Goose</i></b> features story notes on the back
cover. it  also doesn't have the "music inspired by" subtitle. The bands
name is printed in pink letters. I believe this the earliest
release  of the album.
It is said there is a double-fold version of the LP but I've never seen one.<p>

<b>Note:</b> A remastered edition of <b><i>The Snow Goose</i></b> has been released in 2002 by Deram/Universal. This edition contains additional 24 minutes in five bonus tracks: <i>Flight of the Snow Goose</i> and <i>Rhayader</i> (Single version), <i>Flight of the Snow Goose</i> (Alternative Single Edit), <i>Rhayader Goes to Town</i> and <i>The Snow Goose / Freefall</i> (live at the Marquee Club, 29th October 1974).

<i><B>The Snow Goose</i></b> is based on the novella "The Snow Goose" by Paul Gallico. The story
 is about a Rhayader, a lonely person who lives in the marshes. One day he
 finds a wounded Snow Goose, and takes care of her. A little girl, Fritha, is
 also  concerned about the goose, and she and Rhayader become friends. By the
 season's end the goose heals, and it is sent free. Following this, Rhayader
 is alone again, as Fritha doesn't come to visit him anymore. Rhayader helps
 saving people at the battle of Dunkirk, and during the battle the Goose
 comes back to help. Rhayader is killed in the battle, and the Goose is then
 named La Princess Perdue. Kids, remember: War is a terrible thing.

While looking up a story for their next album, Bardens had Herman Hesse's
 "Siddhartha" in mind - according to John Gill. On the other hand, according to
 John Tracy, he was into Steppen Wolf. Ferguson suggested
 <i><B>The Snow Goose</i></b> and both him and Latimer outvoted Bardens.

Paul Gallico's publishers threatened to put a court injunction on the
 album,  and therefore it was entitled "music inspired by". Paul Gallico, a non-smoking author, got a bad impression from the band, due to its name.
