<B>CP</b>'s first video bootleg... The <i><B>Pressure Points</i></b> video,
without the
added movie flicks in it, showing more of the band. Here the performance is
presented unedited, from the start till the last encore, with a time code
included (which isn't as annoying as it may sound!) One track is missing
<i>Long Goodbyes</i>, although it is available on the <i><B>Pressure
Points</i></b> video tape. On the other hand, this version features seven more
songs, mostly from the early period of <B>Camel</b>. Beware - the
sound and image quality are not as good as in the <i><B>Pressure Points</i></b> tape,
but still
very enjoyable. Peter Bardens appears on the last three tracks, but his solos
annoyingly remained uncaptured by the cameras.<p>
