<tr><td valign=top><img src="../images/trivia.gif" width=30 height=18 alt="*"></td><td>The CD sleeve was designed by Chris Cavalier and Marc Lisle, <B>Camel</B> fans who also introduced their own design for Camel's 1998 Tour Poster (check it out at their <a href="http://world.std.com/~clad/CamelPoster.html" target="_top">web site</a>). The story behind the cover concept:
"<I>In the early stages of the design process, we kept thinking back to the
coincidental timing of Camel's World tour with the appearance of Comet
Hale-Bopp. Last year at this time, we had read in the news about the
comet's increasing visibility, but had not seen it yet. While in San
Francisco to finally see Camel live in concert, we happened to look up in
the sky early one morning and there it was!  An unforgettable astronomical
event forever married to an unforgettable musical event.
Andy and Susan liked the idea of using the comet as a theme because the
entire band and crew (and fans) have visual impressions of it from various
countries all along the tour route.</I>"
