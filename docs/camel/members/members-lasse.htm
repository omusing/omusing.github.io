Not long ago, (winter '95), he was touring Europe with a band called <i>Mirage</i>. The band included Andy Ward, Dave Sinclair and several more ex-Caravan related members.   <BR></TD></TR>

injury. at that time, he was already involved in several local bands in
Canterbury with Richard Sinclair and guitarist Mark Hewins. in 1983, he
joined the neo-progressive band <i>Marillion</i>, but this didn't last long
because Andy was going through a hard drinking period at the time. later he
played again with Richard Sinclair and was the drummer in his band Caravan
Of Dreams between 1991-93. then he formed <i>Mirage</i> with Peter Bardens (in
1994) but was replaced with an American drummer, Dave Cohen. nowadays, Andy
tours with Bevis Frond and records with singer/guitarist Todd Dillingham.<BR></TD></TR>

His first professional band was Circus (1967-70), with whom
he recorded an album. then he joined King Crimson (1970-72), playing on
three studio albums and one live album. in the following period he gained
fame as a top session musician and mainly worked in the studio, although he
was also a member of Kokomo (1973-76). after Camel he continued his career
as session musician, was also noted for playing live with Dire Straits and
Roger Waters. (Also: <i>Clannad, Eric Clapton, Anthony Phillips, Tears for Fears</i>, blabla, I can go on forever) Nowadays he is still a session musician although he's less
active.   <BR></TD></TR>

Colin was involved in the band 3 Mustaphas 3.<BR></TD></TR>

He has been involved in the Scottish rock scene since the
mid-60's as a professional musician. in the early 70's, he was the bass
player and singer with the band <i>Pilot</i>, also featuring Ian Bairnson
(guitars) and Stuart Elliott (drums). <i>Pilot</i> was absorbed into the <i>Alan Parsons Project</i>
 and Paton played on all of Parsons' albums between 1975-85.
later he played for <i>Kate Bush, Chris DeBurgh, Chris Rea, Rick Wakeman</i> and <i>Elton John</i> among others. 
In the early 80's, he joined Fish's backing band (he left in the early 90's). He also
released a solo album around 1993, but its release was quite confidential <BR>

He was the drummer in 10cc when Godley & Creme left the
band in 1976. He stayed for several years, and worked with musicians like
Duncan MacKay and Stuart Tosh in 10cc. In 1983, he drummed for Jethro Tull
for one tour. Burgess is now the father of a young son and is not sure
about his future in Camel as he hesitates between carrying on as a musician
or choosing a quieter life with his family.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="sinr">Richard Sinclair<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Bass & vocals</FONT></TD><TD valign=top>Rain Dances, A Live Record </TD><TD>
Sinclair is a former Caravan member, and was supposed to tour with <i>Mirage</i> in winter '95.
Although he was contacted for it, he didn't play. Caravan Of Dreams stopped for good in 1994 (I was at their last
performance in London). now his band, when he has one (he does mainly solo
tours) is called RSVP, and features Patrice Meyer (guitar), Tony Coe
(clarinet) and David Rees-Williams (keyboards). he has released two solo
albums : "Caravan Of Dreams" (April 1992) and "RSVP" (June 1994).  <BR>

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="sim">Mickey Simmonds<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Keys</FONT></TD><TD valign=top>Never Let Go and Harbour of Tears</TD><TD valign=top>Played with some different famous musicians. One example is <i>Mike Oldfield</i>. One thing that is so special with him is his ability to play with his feet. On the tour in '92 (recorded as the <i>Never let Go</i> album)  he played for 2 persons, making it possible to tour as a four-piece, not a five... Played an important role on first solo album of <i>Fish</i>, now has his own solo album</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="schj">Jan Schelhaas<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Keys</FONT></TD><TD valign=top>Breathless, Nude</TD><TD valign=top>Ex <i>Caravan</i> member.  he started in National Head Band in 1971-72, which was a
Uriah Heep related band. then he was in Gary Moore's backing band, playing
on his first solo album. eventually he joined Caravan in replacement for
David Sinclair, from August 1975 to May 1978 when Caravan broke up. after
he left Camel (his last tour was the "Nude" tour in 1981) he apparently
owned his own studio but was also known to be a driving instructor (tutor?)

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="wat">Kit Watkins<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Keys</FONT></TD><TD valign=top>I can see y.h.f.h., Camel On The Road '82</TD><TD valign=top>
He was the founder and co-leader with Frank Wyatt of the
extraordinary progressive rock band <i>Happy the Man</i>, between 1972 and 1979.
The band released two albums for Arista, and recorded a third one in demo
form. It was released in 1983 and included HTM's version of "Eye Of The
Storm" which Kit brought to Camel at the time of "I Can See Your House From
Here". In the early 80's, Kit divided his time between England and America.
as a result, he didn't take part in the sessions for "Nude" and "The Single
Factor" but (like Jan Schelhaas) played on both tours. But he was
dissatisfied with life on the road and the impossibility to get more
involved in the composition process of Camel, so he went back to America
where he enjoys an honorable solo career as a mainly new-age artist. Of
note, though, was his participation in Richard Sinclair's 1994 album,
"RSVP". A reformation of HTM has been talked of for several years, but it
has still not happened because of incompatible schedules.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="mac">Duncan Mackay<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Keys</FONT></TD><TD valign=top>Nude and The Single Factor</TD><TD valign=top> He released several solo albums in the 70's, of excellent
keyboard-based progressive rock (one of them was produced and partly sung
by John Wetton). He was the keyboard player in Steve Harley's Cockney Rebel
until he joined the Alan Parsons Project studio group in the late 70's.
Little has been heard of him since his participation in Camel's "Nude" and
"Single Factor".</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="colp">Phil Collins<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Percussion</FONT></TD><TD valign=top> I can see your House from Here</TD><TD valign=top>Phil was  the lead vocalist and percussionist in <i>Genesis</i> at this time. He was also member of a jazzy group called <i>Brand X</i>. I suppose he was interrested in the jazzier Camel and said yes to helping them on the album. And I suppose it was because Peter Gabrial probably called up Phil and told
him to check out this new keyboard player in this band called Camel, because
Peter knew all about Kit Watkins from hanging out in the Washington DC area.
 Gabriel had jammed with Happy the Man a bunch and tried to hire them as his
backup band, they refused (probably their big mistake).

<TR><TD valign=top><a name="sind">David Sinclair<br><FONT  SIZE=-2 COLOR=#80536D Face=ARIAL>Keys</FONT></TD><TD valign=top> -none-</TD><TD valign=top>Played together with Schelhaas for Camel on the '78-'79 tour. He's a Caravan member, but surely hasn't been a stable-one. Played for them 1968-72, 1976-77, 1981-82, 1990-92. Apparently, he's playing for them again.  between his stints with Caravan, he was also a member of
Matching Mole and Hatfield and the North, but left early in those bands'
careers (although he did play on MM's first album). on the compilation
album "Chameleon", he is mention as playing keyboards on "Rainbow's End"
from "Breathless". David Sinclair has been involved in all Caravan projects
since 1980 ("The Album" and "Back To Front" albums, reformation concerts in
1983 and 1985, reformation tours in 1990-92, and more recently he played on
"The Battle Of Hastings" (1995) and "All Over You" (1996) and the Autumn
1996 tour in England).  <BR>

Manzanera. Eventually he formed the group Sky with several other studio
musicians (John Williams, Tristan Fry, Kevin Peek and Herbie Flowers). He
left Sky around 1982-83 then did sessions and solo albums.<BR></TD></TR>
