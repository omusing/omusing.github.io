<center><h2>Mirage</h2></center>

Peter Bardens, Andy Ward, Dave Sinclair and several more ex-<B>Caravan</b>
related members formed <B>Mirage</b>, in 1994. The band toured Europe during
the winter of 1995, giving numerous performances in which they played 
many <B>Camel</b> and <B>Caravan</b> songs.<br>
A double live CD was released by Voiceprint, which can be reached at this 
address:
<ul>
 Voiceprint Mailorder<br>
 P.O.Box 5<br>
 Derewenstide<br>
 County Durham DH9 7HR<br>
 England<br>
</ul>
<p>

Early expectations of any studio release by <b>Mirage</b> proved wrong. Peter Bardens
is still using the name as his own band, and Steve Adams is the only member left from 
the 1995 tour lineup. The members of <b>Caravan</b> have since gone in attempts to 
reform their band. The address for the Mirage correspondence was previously available
here, but ommitted as it is no longer active. Please don't bother sending letters or
money there!
