<H2><CENTER>Camel's members careers</CENTER></H2>

<B>Webmaster's Note:</B> This section is really rather poor. Not that there's nothing to tell about Camel's past and present members; It's just that I believe most of it
has been done quite efficiently on other web sites and other documents.<P>
<p>

<CENTER><h3><a name="ferguson">Doug Ferguson</a></H3></CENTER>
Ferguson was the first to leave the original Camel line up, back in 1976, after the Moonmadness tour, as explained by Latimer - due to feeling uncomfortable with 
the jazzier music the band was pursuing. Doug then played with <b>Headwaiter</b> which also released a self-titled album. Contrary to what some fans think, today he is a property developer.  He enjoys playing for fun in pubs with Big Jim
Sullivan and others. 
<p>

<CENTER><h3><a name="bardens">Peter Bardens</a></H3></CENTER>
<p>
Bardens released two albums before forming Camel in 1972, and left the band in 1978, after finishing the recording of <b><i>Breathless</i></b>.
He has since then pursued a career as a new age musician with several successful albums. He has occasionally performed songs with Camel as a guest musician, and is said to have kept a good relationship with Latimer.<br>
Bardens was diagnosed with a brain tumour during 2001. He was operated, but was eventually succumbed by lung cancer. Peter Bardens passed away on Tuesday, 22nd January 2002.

<CENTER><H3><a name="ward">Andy Ward</a></H3></CENTER>
<p>
Andy Ward was forced to leave Camel in 1982, due to alchoholism and drug abuse. Ward then joined Marillion for a brief time, and he appears in
the video of <i>Garden Party</i>, though he didn't participate in any
recording
with the group. He is, however, listed in the 'special thanks' list of
their <i><B>Fugazi</i></b> album.<br>
Andy has become a familiar musician among the Canterbury progressive scene. He played drums on Richard Sinclair's band during the mid 90's, and is featured on Sinclair's albums <b><i>Caravan of Dreams</i></b>, <b><i>R.S.V.P</i></b> and <b><i>An Evening of Magic</i></b>.Ward and Richard Sinclair appear on Todd Dillingham's CD, <i><B>The Wilde
Canterbury Dream</i></b>.<br>
Ward has also been a member of <b>Skaboosh</b>, <b>FF</b>, 
<b>Yukio Yung</b> and most notably <b>Bevis Frond</b>.<br>
Despite his outstanding playing, Andy's addiction eventually caused him to depart from these groups.<br>
You can read more about him at <a href="http://www.musart.co.uk/Welcome.html" target="_top">Musart</a>, 
and his own page (which he intends to develop) is specifically at <a href="http://www.musart.co.uk/andwar1.htm" target="_top">this location</a>.

<CENTER><H3><a name="mirage">Mirage</a></H3></CENTER>

<B>Mirage</B> was formed in 1994 by Peter Bardens, Andrew Ward, past members of <b>Caravan</b> (Dave Sinclair, Jimmy Hastings and Pye Hasting) 
and other Canterbury artists (Steve Adams, Rick Biddulph). 
The band made 
an unsuccessful world-tour, performing material by <B>Camel</B>, <B>Caravan</B> and the individual artists.
Following this the band split up. A double live CD, <B><I>Mirage Live 14.12.94</I></B> was released and is now deleted. 
In 1995, Peter Bardens regrouped the band with Steve Adams and two other musicians, under the title
<B>Pete Bardens' Mirage</B>. The band attempted 
writing new material and touring, the output of that featured in <I><B>Pete Barden's Mirage - Live Germany 1996</B></I>. 
Following Bardens' departure, the band's 1997 tour got cancelled. The 3 other band members reformed as <B>Hush</B>.<BR>

<CENTER><H3><a name="colin">Colin Bass</a></H3></CENTER>
Colin Bass started playing bass in 1969, joining several known and lesser-known bands such as Steve Hillage, the <b>Casual</b> band and <b>Clancy</b>. In 1979 he was introduced to <b>Camel</b> by Steve Hillage's former manager, Laurie Small.
Colin participated in playing and co-writing in <b><i>I Can See Your House From Here</i></b> and <b><i>Nude</i></b> before joining the <b>3 Mustapha 3</b> band during the 80s, adopting the pseudonym "Sabah Habas Mustapha" and releasing a hit single.
Since <b>Camel</b>'s return to form in 1991 Colin has played an important role, working closely with Andrew Latimer on playing and production of <b>Camel</b>'s new releases.<br>
Colin released a CD of indonesian-influenced songs as his alter-ego Sabah Habas Mustapha, and recently released a second solo album, <b><i>An Outcast of the Islands</i></b>, featuring Latimer and Dave Stewart as well as members of polish bands Quidam and Abraxas.
The CD was enthusiatiastically received by Camel fans. A review of <a href="http://www.magenta.co.il/ofirz/music/music1.htm"><b><i>An Outcast of the Islands</i></b></a> is available.
