<li><a name="1"></a><h4>When and where was <b>Camel</b> originally formed?</h4>
Andrew, Andy and Doug met Peter Bardens in Hampstead (North London) on 20th September 1971.
Their first gig was on October 8th 1971, in Belfast as "On". This was due to Peter Bardens' 
obligation to Transatlantic Records. <b>Camel</b>'s first public appearance took place at the 
Waltham Forest Technical College, supporting <b>Wishbone Ash</b>, in December 4th, 1971.<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="2"></a><h4>Who gave Camel their name? Why <b>Camel</b>?</h4>
None of the members can really remember. They had many names and this is what they ended up with.
The <b>Mirage</b> newsletter claims Bardens came up with the name, but this information is unreliable.<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="3"></a><H4>Which of the original members has remained in the group?</H4>
Of the original <b>Camel</b> lineup, only Andy Latimer has remained. The original group lasted
about five years and released four studio albums. Doug Ferguson, who 
played bass, was the first to leave in 1976, feeling uncomfortable with the jazzier sound <b>Camel</b>
were aiming at. Peter Bardens left in 1978 in pursuit of a solo career. Barden had guest appeared
in one track on <b><i>The Single Factor</i></b> and on the <b><i>Pressure Points</b></i> live 
album. Andy Ward, the drummer, was the last original member to leave <b>Camel</b>, back in 1982.<BR>

<p>
<li><a name="4a"></a><H4>Why did Doug Ferguson leave Camel in 1976?</H4>
Doug Ferguson left Camel just before the recordings of <B><I>Rain Dances</I></B> were started. The band wanted to move on toward jazzier
music, especially Andy Ward.  Doug felt uncomfortable with that, and eventually chose to quit.
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="4b"></a><H4>Why did Peter Bardens leave Camel in 1978?</H4>
Andrew Latimer explains: 
<I>Peter and I always get on well when creating, but the
problems started when we came to the actual
execution of the ideas. In the studio, Peter and I were
just stifling each other. I wouldn't let him get any of his
ideas out and he wouldn't let me get any of mine out,
so it became pretty heavy going. We mutually agreed
to part company on the creative level. Richard and
Andy wanted to stay with me, so Peter went. I think it
was a very good move for both of us.</I><BR> 
Bardens left Camel in 1978, after the recordings of the <B><I>Breathless</I></B> album were finished. 
The last track on the album, <I>Rainbow's End</I>, is dedicated to him.
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="4c"></a><H4>Why did Andy Ward leave Camel in 1982?</H4>
For many years, the official reason was, as written in <b><i>The Single Factor</i></b> liner notes, a hand injury.
The truth was let out in an interview Ward gave to the Q Magazine in 1991; Ward, being unable to cope with
the pressure he was under, suffered from alchoholism and made a suicide attempt by cutting his wrist. 
Although he has made many attempts to recover since, all the people involved feel that his rejoining an
active group such as <b>Camel</b> would be too difficult for him to handle. Andy has been playing with
lower-key groups that hopefully will let him express his ability without harming himself. It appears that for 
these reasons Ward will never play with <b>Camel</b> again. This notification
has been approved for publication by <b>Camel Productions</b>, as all the people involved believe it to be
best told than kept secret.<BR>

<p>
<li><a name="5"></a><H4>So wasn't there any other stable lineup?</H4>
<B>Camel</b>'s lineup has been constantly changing since 1977. The 1977 lineup, featuring
Mel Collins and Richard Sinclair seemed stable enough, but has changed after releasing two studio 
albums (<b><i>Rain Dances</i></b> and <b><i>Breathless</i></b>) and four tracks of <b>Camel's</b> 
first live release, <b><i>A Live Record</i></b>. Mel Collins kept guest appearing on almost 
every album till 1984's <b><i>Pressure Points</b></i>. Colin Bass has been in Camel since <b><i>I Can See Your House From Here</b></i> in 1979, although he didn't participate in the sessions of <i><b>The Single Factor</b></i> and <i><b>Stationary Traveller</b></i>. 
Susan Hoover has been writing lyrics and providing album concepts since <b><i>Nude</i></b> in 1982, 
and has become Andy Latimer's wife.<BR>

<p>
<li><a name="6"></a><h4>Who has played in <b>Camel</b> trough the years?</h4>
Well... Lot's of people. Better consult the <a
href="http://home.sn.no/~laodegar/camel/members.htm">Camel
Musicians List</a>
from the <a href="http://home.sn.no/~laodegar/camel/" target="_top">Moonmadness</a> site.<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="7"></a><h4>What are Bardens, Ward and Ferguson doing now?</h4>
The location listed in the previous answer should answer this, but you can also check out <a href="..\members\members-fr.htm" target="body">Members Section</a> in the <a href="http://www.magenta.co.il/camel" target="_top">Skylines Camel Web Site</a> site.<BR>

<p>
<li><a name="8"></a><h4>Why, as the years have gone on, has Andy stuck with the name "Camel"?</h4>
Andy considered dropping the name at one point, but is was the fans writing to him, asking
him not to do so.<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="9"></a><h4>To what extent is Camel really a 'band' effort? How much did Mickey Simmonds contribute to <i>Harbour of Tears</i>?</h4>
The participanting musicians always contribute their indelible stamp on the feel and sound of Camel's albums. Colin's Bass is
most evident through the years. Simmonds' contribution to <i>Harbour of Tears</i> left much to be desired, but he simply wasn't able to find the time.<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="10"></a><H4>Whatever happened in those 'lost' years between 1985 and 1991?</H4>
Latimer was troubled with legal problems. <b>Camel</b> were sued by their first manager, 
Geoff Jukes, for past commissions. Latimer, being the only original member left in 
<b>Camel</b>, had to defend it from 1982 until 1987. Susan Hoover had by then 
discovered that royalties from <b>Camel</b>'s back catalog were not being paid to <b>Camel</b>,
and Latimer had to sue <b>Gama Records</b> (Goeff Jukes and Max Hole's company). Latimer won
both cases but received no financial gain. Andy and Susan Hoover left for the US in 1988. <b><i>Dust
and Dreams</b></i> was conceived by the end of 1985, but Latimer wasn't able to persuade any company
to produce it. Hoover and Latimer then formed <b>Camel Productions</b>, and  
it was finally released in April 1991, with the second part of the original piece completely 
re-written. <b><i>Dust and Dreams</i></b> was virtually recorded in England, California and Holland
(where Ton Scherpenzeel lives).<br>
Typical of these lost years is that almost every company that ever had their right to distribute
<B>Camel</b>'s music has done it. Four (4!) collections were released between 1985 and 1991, while
no new material was released.<BR>

<p>
<li><a name="11"></a><H4>Are there any <b>Camel</b> rare unreleased tracks?</H4>
Quite a few, most notably <I>River Man</I> and <I>Nobody Knows</I>. Please consult the <a href="../misc/rarities.htm">Rarities</a> page.
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>

<p>
<li><a name="12"></a><H4>Did Andrew Latimer create any music outside <b>Camel</b>?</H4>
Latimer has been involved in several projects.  He played on several tracks with Doug 
Ferguson in his band's self-titled album, <b><i>Headwaiter</i></b>, and he toured Holland with 
them ('just for the fun') in 1978.<br>
Andrew also sang backing vocals on Peter Bardens' song <i>On a Roll</i> from his 1995 <b><i>Big Sky</i></b> album.<br>
A collaboration of Latimer and Ton Scherpenzeel produced about ten pieces that never got 
into recording stages. Andrew is featured on Ton's 1984 album <I><B>Heart of the Universe</B></I> along with Chris Rainbow. He also co-wrote the track "Wheels".
Future collaboration is doubtful as Ton won't fly at all.<br>
The BBC used some <b>Camel</b>
music, yet attempts at writing for television never came through. <br>
Antony Phillips and Latimer 
wrote some stuff together somewhere in 1987: A Range Rover advert and a short piece called 
<i>Drive</i> for a golfing video. Latimer also helped Philips on an album (<b><i>Open 
Secrets</b></i>?) he was doing with Dennis 
Quinn in 1988.  Future collaborations, as with Ton's, are doubtful due to the physical distances. <br>
Andy played on several tracks on Francis Monkman's album <B><i>Dweller on the 
Threshold</i></B>. <br> 
He did a single with Chris Thompson (of <b>Manfred Mann</b>) and Hazel 
O'Connor for a greenpeace album. <br>
Fiona Hibbert, a harp player, did a cover of <i>Landscapes</i>, and andrew played piano on 
the track.<br>

<p>
<li><a name="members10"></a><h4>Who is Susan Hoover and how does she relate to <B>Camel</B>?</h4>
Susan Hoover interviewed Andrew Latimer for her radio show, back in 1976. Since 1981's "Nude" and onward, Susan 
provided concept and lyrics for <B>Camel</B>'s album. Susan married Andrew Latimer in [?] and they live today in Mountain View, California.
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="13"></a><H4>Why haven't <b>Camel</b> had any commercial success?</h4>
     This question commonly rises among devoted fans; How could this
     fantastic progressive rock group remain unknown, even among
     progressive music fans. This will perhaps remain a mystery. 
     <B>Camel </B>were distributed under the Deram label which also released other
     "proggies" such as <B>The Moody Blues</B> and <b>Caravan</b>, yet its status drew back
     compared with the rising of labels such as EMI, Charisma, Virgin and 
     Atlantic who released some successful prog bands.<br>
     The band never saw it's way into producing popular music, yet were
     pushed toward it by the record company, which released singles of
     tracks that were never really considered by the band to hit the
     charts. This attempt to create hit songs is most obvious in <B><I>The Single Factor</I></B>, an album 
     Latimer himself doesn't feel too satisfied with till this day.<br>
     It wouldn't be fair to say there wasn't any commercial success, <B>Camel</B>
     toured extensively for many years, and the band's reformation in 1991
     was followed by tremendous success under an independent label. <B>Camel</B>
     seems to be more satisfied with personal contact with their fans
     and releasing one album every several years (but with better
     production values). For <B>Camel</B>, as well as the fans, this is perhaps
     all the success that is needed.<BR>

<p>
<li><a name="14"></a><h4>Which is the most successful album?</h4>
<B><i>The Snow Goose</i></b> went gold, and still sells very well. Of CP's releases, <b><i>Dust and Dreams</i></b> has sold the best, probably 
due to having been out since 1991. Also, <b><i>Harbour of Tears</b></i> has succeeded far beyond <b>CP</b>'s expectations.
<BR>

<P>
<li><a name="15"></a><H4>Did <b>Camel</b> ever have a hit single?</H4>
Though obviously aiming at it at one point or another, Latimer admits <b>Camel</b> never had a
hit single. According to him, it was mostly the 'Record Company' who bothered to release some songs 
as singles. 
<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<P>
<li><a name="16"></a><h4>What's the most popular <b>Camel</b> song?</h4>
This could somehow be estimated: The sequence of <i>Rhayarder</i> and <i>Rhayader Goes to Town</i> appear on 3 live albums and 4 compilations, and also received some radio air play, so perhaps it's reasonable to say this is the most popular <b>Camel</b> song.
The most favourite live song is <b>Never Let Go</b> which appears on 3 live albums and one compilation. It's runner ups are perhaps <i>Lady Fantasy</i> and <i>Sasquatch</i>, both being quite popular on compilations as well.
<i>Freefall</i>, <i>A Song Within a Song</i>, <i>Echoes</i>, <i>Drafted</i>, <i>Lies</i> seem to be of the more popular among the collections and compilations.
<i>Down on the Farm</i> is certainly an oddball: Being a typical Richard Sinclair foolish song on a non-typically Sinclair band brought some diverse opinions about the <b><i>Breathless</i></b> album as whole. Some people love it, some people can't stand it. What's certain is that nobody can hear it without stopping to come up with an opinion...<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="17"></a><h4>What is this <b>Camel Productions</b>?</h4>
<b>Camel Productions</b> is the independent company Susan Hoover and Andy Latimer formed
in California. As written in answer (8), After years of attempts to find a record company that would release <b><i>Dust and Dreams</i></b>
the couple decided that the only way to do it was to form their own record company. <b>Camel Productions</b>
operates only for <b>Camel</b>.<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="18"></a><h4>Can we build up hopes to hear more of <b>Camel</b>? Is the production company doing well?</h4>
Every profit <b>Camel</b> makes (from Sales of new albums and from the back catalog, live performances and merchandise) is poured into <b>Camel Production</b>. After more than a decade, <b>Camel Productions</b> seems thriving.<BR>

<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="19"></a><h4>Is there a new album coming up?</h4>
Camel's next studio album, <b><i><a href="../albums/anod.htm">A Nod and a Wink</a></i></b> is expected to be released during the summer of 2002.
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>

<li><a name="23"></a><h4>How can I order the new albums?</h4>
I compiled a page of <a href="../misc/purchase.htm">Camel Production's CD catalog and prices</a>. The page has a list of online retailers who sell Camel CDs.
<P>
<li><a name="touring01"></a><h4>Is Camel still touring?</h4>
<b>Camel</b>'s last tour during late 2000 and early 2001 was burdened with misfortune, but gave the band great satisfaction. <b>Camel Productions</b> reports a world tour is expected by the end of 2002. 
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>

<li><a name="touring02"></a><h4>Why weren't there any songs from <B><I>Stationary Traveller</I></B> played on the 1997 and 1992 tours?</h4>
A few suggestions implied that it was Chris Rainbow's vocals, characteristic of the <I><B>Stationary Traveller</B></I> 1984 tour, which were all sung in a range that was difficult for both Andrew Latimer and Colin Bass voices. But this suggestion is probably wrong as only two songs from <B><I>ST</I></B> were originally sung by Rainbow. Susan Hoover's official reply: 
"They didn't perform anything from <I><B>Stationary Traveller</B></I>. No real reason; the material just didn't fit into the set time or flow-wise.
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>

<li><a name="20"></a><h4>I'm a Camel newbie, which album is mostly recommended?</h4>
Tough question. As observed recently in the <b>Camelogue</b> mailing list, <b>Camel</b>'s fans
vary in their opinions. This may give some hints (though I'd appreciate further notes from other
people!). I've mentioned various bands here (out of my own repertoire) - this is not to say that Camel sounds like them, but rather give a general direction for musical spheres.
<ul>
<li>For all of you who appreciate concept albums, better check out: <b><i>The Snow Goose</b></i>, <b><i>Nude</b></i>, <b><i>Stationary Traveller</b></i>, <b><i>Dust and Dreams</b></i>, <b><i>Harbour of Tears</b></i>. All these albums are based on novels and short stories.
<li>If you're into symphonic progressive rock, such as middle 70's <b>Genesis</b> and <b>Pink Floyd</b>, then 1975's <b><i>The Snow Goose</b></i> and 1976's <b><i>Moonmadness</b></i> may fit you just right.
<li>D'you like <b>Alan Parsons Project</b>? Well, most of that band (and some of its spirit) is featured on <b><i>Stationary Traveller</b></i> and <b><i>The Single Factor</b></i>.
<li>How about this ancient progressive rock, with the rough edge sound and tight Organ/Guitar interplays (<b>Nektar</b> would be fine, as well as some instrumental <b>Jethro Tull</b> and <b>Focus</b>)? Better check out <b><i>Mirage</b></i> and <b><i>Camel</b></i>, their debut. An updated version of all that is featured on some tracks of <b><i>I Can See Your House From Here</b></i>.
<li>If you like <b>Caravan</b> or <b>Hatfield and the North</b>, then you'll find Richard Sinclair's jazzy presence and typical approach to life on <b><i>Rain Dances</b></i>, and even more on its follower, <b><i>Breathless</b></i>. If however you liked those bands for its instrumental interplays, I suggest you'd look for camel's first four albums w/o sinclair, <b><i>Camel</b></i>, <b><i>Mirage</b></i>, <b><i>The Snow Goose</b></i> and <b><i>Moonmadness</b></i>
<li>There is some impressive guitar work on almost every Camel album. Better check out <b><i>Moonmadness</b></i>, <b><i>Breathless</b></i>, <b><i>I Can See Your House From Here</b></i>, <b><i>Nude</b></i> and <b><i>Dust and Dreams</b></i>, as well as the double live album, <b><i>Never Let Go</b></i>.
<li>How about a little orchestration? <b><i>The Snow Goose</b></i>, <b><i>Nude</b></i>, <b><i>I Can See Your House From Here</b></i> and <b><i>Harbour of Tears</b></i> have it, some more some less.
<li><b>Clannad</b> and <b>Enya</b> are your among your favourites? <b>Camel</b>'s roots in the spirit of Ireland are heavily featured in <b><i>Harbour of Tears</b></i>.
<li>Live Records - <b><i>Never Let Go</b></i> stands out with it's outstanding sound quality and the musician's technical ability. It is arguably the bands best recorded live album. It's also arguably one of the best live albums in Progressive Rock. It's also arguably the best album to start with if you haven't heard <b>Camel</b> before. It is also arguable.
<li>Most arguable albums: Give us your own opinion after you've heard <b><i>Breathless</b></i> and <b><i>Stationary Traveller</b></i>.
<li>Best Video: There are only two. I recommend <b><i>Total Pressure</b></i> for being about an hour longer. The video and audio quality is fair, but the alternative video is only a little better.
<li>What collection should you buy? I'd rather have the whole catalog and make my own collections... <b><i>A Compact Compilation</b></i> is a terrific presentation of Camel's albums from 1974 to 1977, but once you'll have it I suppose you'd like to have the original releases. <b><i>Echoes</b></i> is certainly the widest, most extensive collection.
</ul><BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="21"></a><h4>What's with all that cigarette brand name and logo?</h4>
There isn't any connection between the band <b>Camel</b> and the <b>Camel</b> cigarette brand.
The cigarette pack is immitated in the UK release of the <b><i>Mirage</i></b> album, and the camel image associated with
<b>Camel Productions</b> looks very much like the cigarette logo, but hey, it's an side-view image of a Camel... what else would you expect?!<BR>
<A href="#TOP"><IMG SRC="../images/camelhr.gif" border=0 width=460 height=44 alt="Click here to the top of the page"></a>
<p>
<li><a name="22"></a><h4>Why is <b>Caravan</b> often mentioned along with <b>Camel</b>?</h4>
Although <B>Camel</b> wasn't really a "Canterbury band", it was considered for may years to fit in the same musical field that included bands such as <b>Soft Machine</b>, <b>Caravan</b>, <b>Gong</B>, <b>Hatfield and the North</b>, <b>National Health</b> and more, because in
its early years <b>Camel</b> music style had something in common. In 1977, Richard Sinclair (previously of <b>Caravan</b> and <b>Hatfield and the North</b>) was invited to play bass,
and by 1978 Jan Schelhaas and Dave Sinclair (which have both been keyboard players in <b>Caravan</b>) have joined the band for a live tour. The link to <b>Caravan</b> is therefore quite notable.<br>
<b>Camel</b> relates in very same ways to <b>Alan Parson Project</b>, who's musicians David Paton, Chris Rainbow and Stuart Tosh were also featured on some <b>Camel</b> releases and live tours.<BR>
