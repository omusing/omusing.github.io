<a name="contribute"></a>
<center><h2>How do I contribute?</h2></center>
Glad you've asked, I don't get much of these, and when I do - they're welcome. Here are a few things I'm looking for:
<ul>
<li>I want our world to be better. Please smile more often, especially at unknown people. Consider helping old ladies cross the street. Preserve nature. Donate to charity... But seriously, I'd appreciate:
<li>John Tracy's CD Liner notes for the following albums: <b><i>Moonmadness</b></i> (I used to have it but I lost it!), <b><i>Nude</b></i> (if there are any notes...), and <b><i>Stationary Traveller</b></i> (if there are any at all)
<li>TABs, Chords, Midi or other music-oriented files you may have (please don't start sampling songs - I don't have disk space for that!)
<li>If you have a list of <b>Camel</b>'s tour dates - I'd appreciate that in the hope of making a full list of their live performances.
<li>Your questions! Should this site leave your queries unresolved, please let me know about it, and hopefully we'll be able to relieve your pain.
<li>Tour programs. Have you got one? Can you make a photo copy and send it over? Can you scan it and send it via e-mail?
<li>Articles and interviews, if you've got any - please act as in the previous line.
<li>Your general thoughts, comments, spelling corrections, grammar correction, manners correction etc. :-)
