On September 1st 1980 CAMEL joined forces with Sky Production<BR>
Team Tony Clark and Haydyn Bendall. In Studio 3 of Abbey Road<BR>
they recorded the ninth addition to CAMEL's repertoire: NUDE.<P>
A band that has taken advantage of changes both past and present,<BR>
CAMEL have expanded ever further with NUDE.<P>
Before entering the studio, Kit and Jan departed briefly to pursue<BR>
personal projects. Tony then suggested Duncan Mackay - who had <BR>
previously left 10CC for a solo career - and was available to lend<BR>
an expert hand in the making of NUDE. Mel Collins produced his<BR>
usual brilliance now natural to the overall sound of CAMEL and<BR>
Andrew and Andy have maintained the strength of the unit with the<BR>
rhythmic compliment of Colin Bass yet again.<P>
With the industry uncertain of direction, CAMEL have spent 1980<BR>
concentrating on their greatest asset - melody and imagination.<BR>
NUDE has risen to the occasion and CAMEL break 1981 with a<BR>
world tour (for which Kit and Jan have returned) to provide a live<BR>
outlet for communication between the CAMELS and the listeners.<BR>
Ultimately, touring is what music is all about and CAMEL wish you<BR>
a Happy NUDE Year.<P>
