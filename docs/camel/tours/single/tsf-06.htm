"We hadn't got the idea of doing a concept album when
we went down there," explains Latimer, "But after a week or
so, we'd decided that a concept album it would be. But Peter
wanted to do Steppen Wolf and I wanted to do The Snow
Goose. Eventually, we agreed on Snow Goose and we worked
hard at it and within two weeks had written the majority of it.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It was a strange album in as much as we wrote the whole
thing and practised each piece, but we never ever played it all
the way through, so we had no real idea what the overall
result would be. But when we heard the finished result we
were chuffed. We thought it was going to be a wondrous
thing."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the production chair for Snow Goose was David
Hitchcock, who had also produced Mirage.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"He helped us organise things like getting together with
David Bedford," explains Latimer. "He more or less took
control when the studio musicians and orchestra came in to
do their parts.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Snow Goose was such a successful album for both Peter and
myself because it came very close to what we had in our
minds about the project.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Whether it was successful as a commercial thing is
irrelevant. It was successful to us - and that's what art's all
about anyway.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"As it happens, it did turn out to be successful for the band
because it pushed us up into the public eye. It was the turning
point for Camel because, up until then, we had been a band
that people took little notice of.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We charted, got a Brightest Hope award from <I>Melody 
Maker</I> and played the Royal Albert Hall concert. We were
working well together, Peter and I, at this stage. We still had
out arguments and disagreements in the studio, but we were
all pulling together. It was a very harmonious time for the
band."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Following Snow Goose was a problem. Latimer: "We
decided to steer clear of conceptual albums and started to put
more emphasis on the vocals. There was also outside pressure
from the record companies, particularly in the US. I recall a
meeting in New York where they were horrified to find that
Snow Goose had no vocals. They freaked!"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After Snow Goose performed live at the Royal Albert Hall
with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by David
Bedford, plus further touring, it was time to start thinking
about the next album - Moon Madness.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Latimer: "That whole album was rushed. We only had
about three weeks to write the material and about the same
period of time to rehearse it. It was fairly successful, though it
wasn't earth shattering. But what it did do was to get us back
into the swing of writing songs again. Also it proved our
most successful album in the US."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The guiding lights and writing through the band's first four
albums were Latimer and Bardens, a team Latimer refers to as
Rogers and Hammersmith. "We'd always worked together
well," says Latimer. "Our situation was probably a lot like
Lennon and McCartney where one of us would write more
than the other in whatever particular number we were doing."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rain Dances saw a noticable change in Camel's musical
direction. In essence, the songs had become shorter and
Jazzier.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It was probably a reaction against Moon Madness, says 
Latimer, but we wanted to do more concise material and we
also wanted to get into jazzier areas. Doug left at that stage
and Richard Sinclair came in. Richard could play all the jazzy
things we wanted - and some of them were quite complex. I
really like Rain Dances. I still listen to it. The actual production
is much better and we were able to stretch out a lot more on
the complex material which we hadn't been able to do before
because Doug and Andie couldn't quite cope with the more
detailed time signatures."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Changes in the band's direction and style have generally
been well-received by their loyal fans. Latimer: "The fans like
to be given something new. One of the reasons Camel has
lasted so long is because we have changed and the fans have
gone with us and accepted the change. But the changes have
never been that drastic."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Throughout Rain Dances, a rift was developing between
Peter Bardens and Andrew Latimer. Both were pulling in
separate musical directions. This trent continued from Rain
Dances until Peter's farewell album with the band, Breathless.
But before Breathless, the band released A Live Record.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Latimer: "What we wanted it to be was more or less a
history of the band - it was meant to be a life history rather
than a great sounding live record."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While working on Breathless, the rift between Bardens and
Latimer became more apparent. Latimer: "Peter and I always
get on well when creating, but the problems started when we
came to the actual execution of the ideas. In the studio, Peter
and I were just stifling each other. I wouldn't let him get any
of his ideas out and he wouldn't let me get any of mine out,
so it became pretty heavy going. We mutually agreed to part
company on the creative level. Richard and Andy wanted to
stay with me, so Peter went. I think it was a very good move
for both of us."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though Bardens finished the album with the band, his
departure created a problem for upcoming touring
commitments. "It was a tricky situation," recalls Latimer.
"But Richard suggested using Dave Sinclair and Jan
Schelhaas with whom he'd worked in Caravan. I thought this
would be a great idea because we'd be able to do much more
adventurous things with two keyboards players. It worked. At
one stage I did think of calling the band Caramel!"<font><BR>
