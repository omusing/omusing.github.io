Welcome to the HTML web edition of The Single Factor (10th Anniversary) Tour Program, from 1982.
<P>
The images and text were kindly scanned by Paul Brow. I made some editing and HTMLing,
in order to represent the booklet as closely as possible to the original, without inflicting you with extra graphic design.
I wish to thank Chris Guest for his help in scanning some bits too.
<P>
Some irrelevant, mostly commercial pages, were ommitted from this web version of the program. 
<P>
Enjoy!
