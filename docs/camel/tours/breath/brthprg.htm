Welcome to the HTML web edition of the Breathless Tour Program, from 1978.<p>
I did my best to represent the original booklet as closely as possible, without inflicting you with extra graphic design. There are some original pictures and some interesting reading matter.<p>
I did however removed some irrelevant, mostly commercial pages from this web version of the booklet.
<p>
Enjoy!<p>
