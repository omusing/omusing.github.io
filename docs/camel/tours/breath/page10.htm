<h2>Dave Sinclair</h2>
</center>
Multi-instrumentalist and one-time restauranteur Dave Sinclair slipped unobtrusively into the wonderful world of music at the tender age of ten. A radio performance by a skiffle group in which the stripling Sinclair played was released as a 45 (or maybe a 78 !). The single didn't exactly establish the group as The Future of Rock 'n'Roll, and Dave has either genuinely forgotten or tactfully refuses to remember what exactly happened after its release.<P>
Zo ! Ve next find Dave Sinclair in 1964, playing bass with the first edition of the seminal C*nt*rb*ry band, Wilde Flowers. He switched to playing organ while with the Wilde Flowers and when they split up in 1966, giving birth to Soft Machine and Caravan, Dave let his fingers do the playing with the latter. He recorded three albums with Caravan, leaving after 'In The Land Of Grey And Pink' in 1971.<P>
Dave then joined ex-Wilde Flower Robert Wyatt's band, Matching Mole (geddit ?), and played keyboards on their eponymous debut album in early 1972.<P>
Wanderlust struck for the fourth time in mid-'72. Dave left Matching Mole before their second (and final) album to play keyboards for a well-known motorway sign, his cousin Richard Sinclair's band Hatfield & The North. Before the Hatfields could become a legend in their own lunchtime, Dave took a slip-road in 1973 - before 'Rotter's Club - and rejoined Caravan.<P>
Only to leave again, three albums later, in 1975.<P>
Thenceforth, Dave Sinclair turned his myriad talents to learning drums, missing beats to build a highly-successful restaurant (replete with Victoriana decor ?) in Canterbury.<P>
 In 1976 Dave started work on a multi-instrumental solo work, as yet unfinished. It was during this time that he was approached by Camel. They also asked if he would care to tinkle with them. Dave accepted, and will be seen duelling digits with Jan Schelhaas on the '78 'Breathless' tour.<P>
