<H2>ANDY WARD (Drums)
</H2>Andy Ward took to the stool at a young age drumming in various teen-bands at school. He played with assorted John's Children no longer with Marc Bolan, assuming a series of "dreadful" names. The line-up kept changing with the names (and vice-versa) and it was by this means that Andy met and made friends with bass-player Doug Ferguson. The band self-destructed. The friendship survived. Doug moved to Guildford where it was inevitable he should meet Andy Latimer who was then talent-scouting for what would be Brew. Ward and Ferguson were rowed in as a package deal rhythm section and in the fullness of time, Brew grew into the prototype CAMEL.
