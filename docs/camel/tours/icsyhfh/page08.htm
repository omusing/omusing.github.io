<H2>COLIN BASS (Bass)</H2>
Typecast from an early age, Colin started playing bass in 1969 and played with various bands, all of whom shall rightly remain nameless. In 1973 he formed Clancy - a multinational band with a cast of thousands - who went on to record two albums for Warner Bros. After four years, Clancy went their diverse ways and Colin joined up with Steve Hillage for a tour and live album, followed by a year mystifying London audiences with the all-but-world-famous Casual band.
In June 1979, former Hillage tour manager, Laurie Small put CAMEL onto Colin who joined the group for rehearsals in Suffolk. Colin and Andy Ward got on famously, and a fab new rhythm section was born.
