Welcome to the HTML web edition of the I Can See Your House From Here Tour Program, from 1980.<p>
The images and text were kindly scanned by John Shelton who send them to me via e-mail (could you believe it?! Technology!). I did some editing and HTMLing, in order to represent the booklet as closely as possible to the original, without inflicting you with extra graphic design. There are some original pictures and some interesting reading matter.<p>
Some irrelevant, mostly commercial pages, were ommitted from this web version of the booklet.
<p>
Enjoy!<p>
