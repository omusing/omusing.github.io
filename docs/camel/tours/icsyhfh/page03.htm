<H2>ANDREW LATIMER (Guitar)</H2>
Whilst hesitant to reiterate yet another bumbling biography of his past,
Andrew admits to being the inevitable protege of a musical family.<BR>
Pushed and cajoled into music lessons, he preferred to teach himself 
the theories and practical aspects of the guitar, forming his first band 
with his brother at fifteen.<BR>
Soon after Andrew went pro with Andy Ward in Brew a blues outfit that was to be the nucleus of CAMEL.
