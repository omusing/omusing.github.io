Welcome to the HTML web edition of the Rain Dances Tour Program, from 1977.
<P>
The images and text were kindly scanned by Paul Brow who send them to me via e-mail. I made some editing and HTMLing,
in order to represent the booklet as closely as possible to the original, without inflicting you with extra graphic design.
Paul made great scans of this beautiful program, and there are some original pictures and interesting reading matter.
<P>
Some irrelevant, mostly commercial pages, were ommitted from this web version of the program. 
These pages are best viewed in 800x600 screen resolution.
<P>
Enjoy!
