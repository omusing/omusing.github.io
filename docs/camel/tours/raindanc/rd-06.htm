	Andrew Latimer, on the other hand, prefers the quiet life. He was born and bred in
	genteel Guilford, and is still a Home Counties man. As a musician, his classical background
	gives to Camel's sound some of its lyrical, melodic quality. He is not, however impressed with
	technical fanatics: "I've never been that kind of musician," he says, "I feel that emotion
	exceeds technicality." This is not to underrate his skill and sensitivity, for, as Chris Welch
	observed in "Melody Maker", he is at last being recognised as one of the most original
	guitar players to emerge for a long while."<br>
