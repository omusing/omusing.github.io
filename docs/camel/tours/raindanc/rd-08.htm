	When Doug Ferguson decided to leave Camel, Richard Sinclair was their first choice for replacement.
	It all worked so well on "Rain Dances" that he became instantly indispensable.
	Richard is a highly-respected musician, one of the doyens of British rock. "Melody Maker" even
	went so far as to say, "he is one of the few rock singers who can actually sing."
	He was a founder member of the Canterbury group Caravan, and later of Hatfield & the North.
	When they disbanded, becoming a "Legend in their Lunchtime", Richard returned to Canterbury, where he played
	local gigs with local musicians, formed a one-off band called Sinclair & the South and learnt the technique
	of making musical equipment.<BR>
