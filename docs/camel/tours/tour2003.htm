<center><h2>Camel's Farewell Tour - 2003</h2></center>
<b>Camel</b>'s 2003 tour is announced as their last farewell tour. This is not the first time <b>CP</b> anounces <b>Camel</b> will stop touring, but this time it seems obvious that the financial and personal costs of touring have taken too much toll to keep the wagon touring around the world. <b>Camel</b> is touring for the last time, to bid farewell to its worldwide fans.
<p>
The band, consisting of Guy LeBlanc, Denis Clements, Colin Bass accompanying Andrew Latimer, originally intended to tour America & Europe during June and July 2003. While rehearsing, Guy LeBlanc was called back to his home in Canada, to care for his wife who suffered a heart attack.
<p>
Tom Brislin replaces Guy LeBlanc on Keyboards in the American leg of the tour. The European leg was delayed to October, with long-time companion Ton Scherpenzeel taking his old role at the keys.
<p>
Among the merchandise sold at the tour you will find the new DVD - "Curriculum Vitae" - the biography of the band.<p>
