<a name="contact"><H3>Getting in touch with <b>Camel</b> and <B>Camel Productions</b></H3></a>
<b>Camel Production</b> (<b>CP</b> for short) is a self owned company which has been managing <b>Camel</b> for over a decade now.<br>
The best thing to do (if you haven't done it so far) is to visit their web site 
(<a href="http://www.camelproductions.com" target=_top>www.CamelProductions.com</a>) where you can find updated news, more information about
the band, as well as purchase CDs of the band's latest offerings.<br>
<b>Camel Production</b> publishes an e-mail based newsletter, entitled <b><i>The Nature of the eBeast</i></b>. 
To subscribe to the <b>CP</b> newsletter, please go to <a href="http://www.camelproductions.com/ebeast.htm" target=_top>this location</a>,

<a name="finding"><H3>Where to buy Camel albums</H3></a>

Here is a list of <a href="purchase.htm">Resources</a> where you can order Camel's Albums.

<B>Camel Productions</B> releases are available in
the UK by Pinnacle Records. In Spain they are distributed through DiscMedi.
<p>

<B>Camel</b>'s CDs have been released by several labels, but I wish
to express my believe that the ones by DERAM label are the most rewarding ones,
at least when it comes to the informative sleeve notes. Regarding the sound
quality - this I've never seriously examined, but I'm content with all the
DERAM CDs I've got. I welcome any other opinions from you, dear reader. <p>

<a name="more info"><H3>Getting to know more about Camel</H3></a>

<ul>
<li> You'll find a lot of material at this site's <a href="..\notes\notes-fr.htm" target="body">Paper Archives</a>. John Tracy's CD liner notes are 
a reliable source for Camel's history, and many of them are currently available. You can also read a few interviews with Andrew Latimer, or visit related links on the web.

<li> Information from the latest years was brought to the fans via Camel's own newsletter, <B>The Nature of the Beast</B>. Web versions of these
papers are available on this server in the <a href="..\notes\notes-fr.htm" target="body">Paper Archives</a>. I recommend that you'd read
an interview with Andy Latimer, from the Autumn 1994 issue.

<li> There's a usenet <B>Camel</b> 
Mailing list.  Here's how
