<CENTER><H2>Camel Poll Results</H2></CENTER>
During April and May 1997, the readers of the <B>Camelogue Mailing List</B> took part in a <B>Camel</B> Poll, which was initiated and arranged by Brett Tiesmaki.<P>
Each reader was allowed to vote for his three (3) favourite Camel albums and his three favourite Camel songs. The replies varied, as some voters prefer to consider the whole <I><B>Snow Goose</B></I> as a single song, or voting for <I><B>A Live Record</B></I>/<I><B>Never Let Go</B></I> for expressing their view of the original studio recordings as an added value...<BR>
But what really counts is that a list of favourite albums was finally made, compiled and delivered by Brett. To quote his own words: <ul><I>So, now that it's done, what does it all mean...?  Well, in my humble
opinion, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!  It was just fun, pure and simple.  However,
it does attest to the broad appeal of Camels' music and the pleasure it
brings to us all;  although their musical palette is diverse, each of us
finds something to relate to and enjoy.<P>

I guess that's the magic of Camel.......
