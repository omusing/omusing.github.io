<center><h2>Camel Desktop</h2></center>
This is a new project I'm trying to run: Following a suggestion by Dr. Gordon C. Bruner II, and partly as one my own ideas, I attempt to create a Camel Desktop theme.
<P>
The project is still in it's start line. People with the "Know-How" are kindly requested to contact me if the want to help. I need programmers in C/C++/Delphi/VB to help
me design a Screen Saver. Macintosh programmers would also help! If you've got an idea or a suggestion, please send them over.
<P>
So far I've done a desktop background image. You can downlaod it and test it. It's a 800x600 image, saved as a BMP file. Download the zip file to your computer,
extract it using any Zip extractor, and place the BMP file in your Windows directory.
<BR>
To configure it as your background image:<ul>
<li>Windows 95 users: use <B>Start</B> button - <B>Settings</B> - <B>Control Panel</B> - <B>Display</B>. Select the <B>Background</B> tab, and select Camel01 in the <B>Wallpaper</B> frame. To make it look better, select the <B>Appearance</B> tab, Select "Desktop" in the <B>Item</B>, and change the colour to Black<BR>
<li>Windows 3.1 users: Open the <B>Main</B> group, open the <B>Control Panel</B>, open the <B>Desktop</B> icon, and select the wallpaper from the list.<BR>
<li>Mac users: please send me your way of doing it!<BR>
</ul>

The wallpapers are all 800x600, but designed to fit to the minimal 640x480 resolution. You should place the wallpaper in the center - not tiled!
For Windows 95 users with 640x480 or 1024x768 (or higher) display, I recommend that you use Microsoft Plus feature
of stretching the wallpaper to fit the screen size. You can download this Plus feature (a part of the
Font Smoothing kit) here: <a href="desktop/w95gray.exe">w95gray.exe (174K executable)</a>.

Contains:
<li>BeerCan.wav - use it for your Windows Entry sound.
<li>Fanfare.wav - use it for your Windows Exit sound.
<li>Baaa.wav - use it for your recycle bin.

Please send me your comments.
